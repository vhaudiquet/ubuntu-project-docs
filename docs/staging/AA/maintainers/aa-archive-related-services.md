# Archive-related services 

```{note}
This page is a seed which will document which services are where, and how they
work. The previous list is being replaced as services are migrated to become
charmed hosted services.
```

```{admonition} This page will be moved to:
maintainers -> AA
ONLY after the content has been added
```

This page documents the services used by the
{ref}`Archive Administrators <archive-administration>` and how they work.

# How to contribute documentation

This guide provides information necessary to contribute to this documentation. If you're contributing for the first time, you might find the Canonical Open Documentation Academy has helpful resources to [get you started](https://documentationacademy.org/docs/howto/get-started/).

## Report an issue

To report a mistake on any page, or highlight some missing documentation, [file an issue](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs/issues) in our issues list on GitHub.
You can do this using the "Give feedback" button on any page, which will open a new issue.

## Edit documentation online

Each documentation page has a **Contribute to this page** link in the top-right corner (the pencil icon). Clicking this button opens the GitHub web editor where you can propose changes to that page. The first time you click this button, you will be prompted to create a **fork** of the documentation before you can start editing.

Remember to first check the [latest version](https://canonical-ubuntu-project.readthedocs-hosted.com/) of our documentation and make your proposal based on that revision.

## Contribute on GitHub

To follow a Git development workflow, `checkout` the [Ubuntu Project docs repository](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs) and contribute your change as a [pull request](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs/pulls).


## Directory structure

All the documentation files are located in the `docs/` directory. The `docs/` directory contains sub-directories corresponding to different [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) sections:

* `explanation/`
* `howto/`
* `reference/`
* `tutorial/`

Add new articles in the appropriate directory. You can read about [how Ubuntu implements Diátaxis for documentation](https://ubuntu.com/blog/diataxis-a-new-foundation-for-canonical-documentation).


## Building the documentation

Follow these steps to build the documentation on your local machine.


### Prerequisites

* Git
* The `make` tool

    :::{note}
    The `make` command is compatible with Unix systems. On Windows, [install Ubuntu with WSL](https://documentationacademy.org/docs/howto/get-started/using_wsl/).
    :::


### Procedure

1. Fork the [Ubuntu Project docs repository](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs). Visit [Fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for instructions.

2. Clone the repository to your machine:
    ```none
    git clone git@github.com:<your_user_name>/ubuntu-project-docs.git
    ```

3. Create a new branch:
    ```none
    git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
    ```

4. Change to the `docs/` directory and make your contribution:
    ```
    cd docs
    ```

5. Build a live preview of the documentation from within the `docs/` directory:
    ```
    make run
    ```
    You can find all the HTML files in the `.build/` directory.

    `make run` uses the Sphinx `autobuild` module, so that any edits you make (and save) as you work are applied, and the built HTML files refresh immediately.

6. Review your contribution in a web browser by navigating to [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

7. Push your contribution to GitHub and create a pull request against the original repository.


## Documentation format

The Ubuntu Project documentation is built with Sphinx using the MyST flavor of the Markdown mark-up language. If you're new to Markdown or MyST, read our [MyST style guide](https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/style-guide-myst/).


## Testing the documentation

Test the documentation before submitting a pull request. Run the following commands from within the `docs/` directory to test the documentation locally:

| command  | use |
|---------|-----|
| `make spelling` | Check for spelling errors; this command checks the HTML files in the `_build` directory. Fix any errors in the corresponding Markdown file |
| `make linkcheck` | Check for broken links |
| `make woke` | Check for non-inclusive language |
| `make pa11y` | Check for accessibility issues |

:::{note}
For the `make spelling` command to work, you must have the `aspell` spellchecker installed. You can install it with `sudo apt install aspell`.

## Open Documentation Academy

If you've never contributed to an open source project before, the [Open Documentation Academy](https://documentationacademy.org/) (ODA) is a great way to begin.

The Open Documentation Academy (ODA) is an initiative led by the documentation team at Canonical to encourage open source contributions from the community, and to provide help, advice and mentorship within a friendly and welcoming environment.

A key aim is to lower the barrier of entry to successful open-source software contributions by making documentation into the gateway, and it’s a great way to make your first open source contributions to projects like ours. Contributors gain real experience, structured support and recognition, while we benefit from improvements to our documentation and community feedback.

The best way to get started is to take a look at our [project-related documentation tasks](https://github.com/canonical/open-documentation-academy/issues) and read our [Getting started](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/getting-started/42769) guide. Tasks typically include testing and fixing tutorials, updating outdated pages, restructuring large documents and anything else you may want to suggest. We'll help you see those tasks through to completion.

Stay in touch either through the task list, or through one of the following locations:

* [Discussion forum](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/community/open-documentation-academy/166) on the Ubuntu Community Hub.
* [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#documentation:ubuntu.com) for interactive chat.
* [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@CanonicalDocumentation) for the latest updates and events.

In addition to the above, we have a weekly [Open Documentation Hour](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/open-documentation-hour-schedule/45291) at 16:00 UTC each Friday. Everyone is welcome.

# MIR team weekly status meeting

The MIR Team holds weekly meetings for 30 minutes every Tuesday at
<time datetime="T16:30+01:00">16:30 CET</time> on the
[Ubuntu Matrix Server](https://ubuntu.com/community/communications/matrix)
in the [Ubuntu Main inclusion requests](https://matrix.to/#/#ubuntu-mir:ubuntu.com) channel.

The purpose of the meeting is:

* to allocate a fair share of work between each member of the MIR team
* to provide a timely response to reporters of MIR requests
* to detect and discuss any current or complex cases

You should attend these meetings if you submit an MIR request, until it is
approved or rejected.

Due to the nature of the
[Ubuntu Development Process](https://canonical-ubuntu-packaging-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/2.0-preview/explanation/development-process/),
there are times (e.g. close to Feature Freeze) when this meeting is busy and
others (e.g. right after a new release) when it is quieter. Consequently,
response times to MIR requests are (on average) usually faster in those quieter
periods after the release of a new Ubuntu version.

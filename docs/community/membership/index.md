**Ubuntu Membership is an official recognition of significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu or the Ubuntu community.**

> "Together we have the opportunity to bring real technological freedom to every
  part of the world, across multiple devices and the cloud, and clothed in an
  elegant, beautiful experience. It is a bold vision, but our greatest strength
  in Ubuntu is our community and together we can do this. Come and join us and
  be a part of bringing Ubuntu to the masses."

# Ubuntu Member email alias

Ubuntu Members are granted special `@Ubuntu.com` aliases they can use to send and receive emails. Official members looking to enable this perk will need to set up a ForwardMail account by following these steps:

1. Log into [ForwardMail](https://forwardemail.net/en/ubuntu) using your UbuntuOne SSO account. Under {guilabel}`Quick Links` beside the [ubuntu.com](http://ubuntu.com/) domain, select **Aliases**.

The Ubuntu Community Council is the primary community (i.e., non-technical) governance body for the Ubuntu project. Members are appointed by Mark Shuttleworth and approved by a vote by the entire Ubuntu membership.

More information on the Council and on Ubuntu governance in general is on the {ref}`Ubuntu Governance page <project-governance>`.


## Delegation

The Community Council {ref}`chose to delegate <delegation>` some of its powers and responsibilities (like approval of Ubuntu membership) to Team Councils.

The governance bodies that need to be restaffed (because of members stepping down or term lengths running out), follow the restaffing process.


## Membership

The current membership of the Council is listed on [its Launchpad page](https://launchpad.net/~communitycouncil/+members).


## Contact info

You can contact the Community Council by posting [a topic in this category](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/documentation/community/14) or by sending an email to [community-council@lists.ubuntu.com](mailto:community-council@lists.ubuntu.com). **All Ubuntu community-related queries and questions are welcome.**

Ubuntu is more than just a name. It embodies the very essence of our community. Deriving from an ancient African word that means “humanity to others”, our mission is and has always been to spread this spirit to the software world.

## Ubuntu Code of Conduct

Members of the Ubuntu Community follow a simple code of conduct that helps ensure our community stays healthy, stable and remains a place for collaboration and prosperity. For those wanting to join in our efforts, it is crucial to learn and embody these important principles.

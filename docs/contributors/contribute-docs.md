# How to contribute docs

This guide provides information necessary to contribute to this documentation.
If you're contributing for the first time, you might find the Canonical Open
Documentation Academy has helpful resources to
[get you started](https://documentationacademy.org/docs/howto/get-started/).


## Report an issue

To report a mistake on any page, or highlight some missing documentation,
[file an issue](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs/issues) in our
issues list on GitHub.

You can do this using the {guilabel}`Give feedback` button on any page, which will open a
new issue.

Make sure to provide enough information in the issue for us to understand what
is needed.


## Edit documentation online

Each documentation page has a **Contribute to this page** link in the top-right
corner (the pencil icon). Clicking this button opens the GitHub web editor
where you can propose changes to that page. The first time you click this
button, you will be prompted to create a **fork** of the documentation before
you can start editing.

Remember to first check the
[latest version](https://canonical-ubuntu-project.readthedocs-hosted.com/) of
our documentation and make your proposal based on that revision.


## Contribute on GitHub

If you are familiar with a Git development workflow, `fork` the
[Ubuntu Project docs repository](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs)
and contribute your change as a
[pull request](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs/pulls).

While this project is under construction, there will be a lot of movement in
many different areas. To ensure that your efforts don't get wasted due to
overlaps, please either **claim an open issue** or, if there is no issue for
what you want to work on, create a new issue first **before** working on your
pull request.


### Directory structure

All the documentation files are located in the `docs/` directory. The `docs/`
directory contains sub-directories according to the type of content.

All content is written and split according to the principles of
[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/). It is then organized for our readers
according to who is using it, and how. Every task, every process, has at least
two people involved: someone who is *contributing* something, and a maintainer
who is responsible for reviewing it.

For contributors, we have:

* **How Ubuntu is made**: Information about Ubuntu and how it's made,
  the processes involved, and concepts contributors need to understand

* **Contributors**: Guides and instructions for submitting or requesting
  changes, fixes, and new packages

For maintainers, we have:

* **Maintainers**: Guides for those with elevated permissions who review and
  approve changes, new packages, and maintain the health of the
  Package Archive. 

* **Who makes Ubuntu**: Information about all the people, roles, and groups
  involved in making Ubuntu, as well as their collective responsibilities, and
  how to join each of the roles.


## Build the documentation locally

Follow these steps to build the documentation on your local machine.


### Prerequisites

* Git
* The `make` tool

    :::{note}
    The `make` command is compatible with Unix systems. On Windows,
    [install Ubuntu with WSL](https://documentationacademy.org/docs/howto/get-started/using_wsl/).
    :::


### Procedure

1. Fork the [Ubuntu Project docs repository](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-project-docs). Visit [Fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for instructions.

2. Clone the repository to your machine:
    ```none
    git clone git@github.com:<your_user_name>/ubuntu-project-docs.git
    ```

3. Create a new branch:
    ```none
    git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
    ```

4. Change to the `docs/` directory and make your contribution:
    ```
    cd docs
    ```

5. Build a live preview of the documentation from within the `docs/` directory:
    ```
    make run
    ```
    You can find all the HTML files in the `.build/` directory.

    `make run` uses the Sphinx `autobuild` module, so that any edits you make (and save) as you work are applied, and the built HTML files refresh immediately.

6. Review your contribution in a web browser by navigating to [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

7. Push your contribution to GitHub and create a pull request against the original repository.


## Documentation format

The Ubuntu Project documentation is built with Sphinx using a combination of the MyST flavor of the Markdown and reStructuredText mark-up languages. MyST is preferred for new content. If you're new to this, see our guides:

* [MyST style guide](https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/style-guide-myst/)
* [reStructuredText style guide](https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/reference/style-guide/)


### Organization principles

To make the documentation sources easy to navigate and read, keep the formatting organization of the content consistent.


#### File names

Unless required (for example, to avoid duplication), use the following file-naming scheme:

- Lowercase with hyphens between words
- File names same as article titles (omit `how-to` from file names)

For example, an article called *How to contribute docs* would have a file name `contribute-docs.md`.


#### Headings

To simplify cross-referencing articles and sections, make anchors predictable. Use anchors with this format:

- Lowercase with hyphens between words
- Anchors same as headings

For example:

```md
(organization-principles)=
### Organization principles
```

Include two empty lines before headings to break the flow of the text and make orientation in files easier.


### Semantic mark-up

We encourage (though not mandate) the use of semantic mark-up where possible. See [Roles](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html) in Sphinx documentation for an overview of inline semantic roles available by default. The syntax is:

| MyST | reStructuredText |
| --- | --- |
| `` {role}`term` `` | `` :role:`term` `` |

The following roles are especially useful:

`code`
: Source-code snippets.

`command`
: Command-line interface (CLI) commands.

`file`
: Names of files and directories (including path).

`guilabel`
: Graphical user interface (GUI) elements: button, widgets, labels, ...

`kbd`
: Keyboard keys and shortcuts. Example:`` {kbd}`Shift+F1` `` (rendered as {kbd}`Shift+F1`).

`manpage`
: Link to an Ubuntu manual page. Example:`` {manpage}`man(1)` `` (rendered as a live link: {manpage}`man(1)`).

`pkg`
: Linux package name (this role is custom to this documentation project).


### Special roles for links

The documentation project defines the following custom roles for simplifying add links to various resources.

`manpage`
: Use to create links to manual pages hosted at [manpages.ubuntu.com](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/). The links always point to manual pages for the latest Ubuntu release.

    ::::{tab-set}

    :::{tab-item} MyST
    Syntax:

    ```md
    {manpage}`<manual-page-name>(<manual-section-number>)`
    ```

    Example:

    ```md
    {manpage}`bash(1)`
    ```
    :::

    :::{tab-item} reStructuredText
    Syntax:

    ```md
    :manpage:`<manual-page-name>(<manual-section-number>)`
    ```

    Example:

    ```md
    :manpage:`bash(1)`
    ```
    :::

    ::::

    Renders as: {manpage}`bash(1)`

`lpbug`
: Use to create links to Launchpad bugs at [bugs.launchpad.net](https://bugs.launchpad.net/).


    ::::{tab-set}

    :::{tab-item} MyST
    Syntax:

    ```md
    {lpbug}`<LP-bug-number>`
    ```

    Example:

    ```md
    {lpbug}`1`
    ```
    :::

    :::{tab-item} reStructuredText
    Syntax:

    ```md
    :lpbug:`<LP-bug-number>`
    ```

    Example:

    ```md
    :lpbug:`1`
    ```
    :::

    ::::

    Renders as: {lpbug}`1`

`lpsrc`
: Use to create links to Ubuntu packages on Launchpad at [launchpad.net/ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu).


    ::::{tab-set}

    :::{tab-item} MyST
    Syntax:

    ```md
    {lpsrc}`<Ubuntu-package-on-LP>`
    ```

    Example:

    ```md
    {lpsrc}`bash`
    ```
    :::

    :::{tab-item} reStructuredText
    Syntax:

    ```md
    :lpsrc:`<Ubuntu-package-on-LP>`
    ```

    Example:

    ```md
    :lpsrc:`bash`
    ```
    :::

    ::::

    Renders as: {lpsrc}`bash`


### Command line and terminal output

Ubuntu Project documentation defaults to presenting command examples and terminal output in the following manner.


#### Command examples

To show an example of a command entered on the command line, use:

* A regular literal block with language type `none` to prevent syntax highlighting.
* Angled brackets (`<>`) to indicate a part to be substituted by the user.
* Square brackets (`[]`) to indicate optional arguments.
* Command split over multiple lines to avoid wrapping or the need to scroll.
* Dollar (`$`) or hash (`#`) character to indicate normal user or superuser prompt respectively.

Example source for MyST:

````none
```none
$ command --option=<mandatory_value> [optional_parameter] && \
  another-command --option --option2
```
````


#### Terminal output

When showing terminal output, use:

* Separate blocks for the invocation and output.
* Suitably shortened output to show only relevant parts.

Example source for MyST:

````none
To enable the example service, run:

```none
$ examplectl start service
```

The output indicates that the example service is now active:

```none
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

[...]
```
````

In case it is useful to show a command using a specific command-line prompt together with the output, use the `terminal` directive.

Example source for MyST:

````none
Run the {command}`command` as the root user to achieve the folowing result:

```{terminal}
:user: root
:host: ubuntu
:dir: /tmp
:input: command --option

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit
```
````


## Testing the documentation

Test your changes before submitting a pull request. Run the following commands from within the `docs/` directory to test the documentation locally:

| command  | use |
|---------|-----|
| `make spelling` | Check for spelling errors; this command checks the HTML files in the `_build` directory. Fix any errors in the corresponding Markdown file |
| `make linkcheck` | Check for broken links |
| `make woke` | Check for non-inclusive language |
| `make pa11y` | Check for accessibility issues |

:::{note}
For the `make spelling` command to work, you must have the `aspell` spellchecker installed. You can install it with `sudo apt install aspell`.

## Open Documentation Academy

If you've never contributed to an open source project before, the [Open Documentation Academy](https://documentationacademy.org/) (ODA) is a great way to begin.

The Open Documentation Academy (ODA) is an initiative led by the documentation team at Canonical to encourage open source contributions from the community, and to provide help, advice and mentorship within a friendly and welcoming environment.

A key aim is to lower the barrier of entry to successful open-source software contributions by making documentation into the gateway, and it’s a great way to make your first open source contributions to projects like ours. Contributors gain real experience, structured support and recognition, while we benefit from improvements to our documentation and community feedback.

The best way to get started is to take a look at our [project-related documentation tasks](https://github.com/canonical/open-documentation-academy/issues) and read our [Getting started](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/getting-started/42769) guide. Tasks typically include testing and fixing tutorials, updating outdated pages, restructuring large documents and anything else you may want to suggest. We'll help you see those tasks through to completion.

Stay in touch either through the task list, or through one of the following locations:

* [Discussion forum](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/community/open-documentation-academy/166) on the Ubuntu Community Hub.
* [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#documentation:ubuntu.com) for interactive chat.
* [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@CanonicalDocumentation) for the latest updates and events.

In addition to the above, we have a weekly [Open Documentation Hour](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/open-documentation-hour-schedule/45291) at 16:00 UTC each Friday. Everyone is welcome.

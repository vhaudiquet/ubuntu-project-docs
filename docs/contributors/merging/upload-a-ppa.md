# Upload a PPA

Following a successful merging procedure, upload the updated package to a {term}`PPA` for building.

(merge-get-the-orig-tarball)=
## Get the orig tarball

Ubuntu doesn't know about the new tarball yet, so we must create it.

```none
$ git ubuntu export-orig
```

If the upstream version does not yet exist in Ubuntu, that is, the new package from Debian also includes a new upstream version, you should add the `--for-merge` option:

```none
$ git ubuntu export-orig --for-merge
```

If this fails, {ref}`do it manually <merge-get-the-orig-tarball-manually>`.


(merge-build-source-package)=
## Build source package

```none
$ dpkg-buildpackage \
    --build=source \
    --no-pre-clean \
    --no-check-builddeps \
    -sa \
    -v3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2
```

The switches are:

`-sa`
: include orig tarball (required on a merge)

`-vXYZ`
: include changelog since `XYZ`

As the merge upload represents all changes that happened in Debian since the last merge plus anything added as part of the merge itself, `-v` should usually point to the last published Ubuntu version. For example:

1. Ubuntu merged as `1.3-1ubuntu1`.
1. Then Ubuntu had a fix in `1.3-1ubuntu2`.
1. But in the meantime, Debian merged upstream as `1.4-1`.
1. And then Debian added a fix in `1.4-2`.
1. New Ubuntu will be `1.4-2ubuntu1`.
1. `-v` should be set to `1.3-1ubuntu2`.
   1. Thereby the `.changes` file will include `1.4-1`, `1.4-2`, and `1.4-2ubuntu1`.
   1. That represents all the changes that happened from the perspective of an Ubuntu user upgrading from `1.3-1ubuntu2` to `1.4-2ubuntu1`.

:::{note}
If sponsoring a merge or any other upload for someone else, remember the need to sign their upload with your key. See {ref}`Sponsor a package <sponsor-a-package>` for more information about that.

Furthermore just like you, the sponsor needs to know about setting `-v` right and using `-sa` when needed. If in doubt, coordinating with them is helpful.

(merge-push-to-your-launchpad-repository)=
## Push to your Launchpad repository

Now that the package builds successfully, push it to your Launchpad repository:

```none
git push <your-lp-username>
```

You get an error message and a suggestion for how to set an `upstream` branch. For example:

```none
$ git push kstenerud
fatal: The current branch merge-lp1802914-disco has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream kstenerud merge-lp1802914-disco
```

Run the suggested command to push to your repository.


(merge-push-your-lp-tags)=
### Push your `lp` tags

```none
$ git push <your-git-remote> old/ubuntu old/debian new/debian \
           reconstruct/<version> logical/<version> split/<version>
```

For example:

```none
$ git push git+ssh://kstenerud@git.launchpad.net/~kstenerud/ubuntu/+source/at \
           old/ubuntu old/debian new/debian \
           reconstruct/3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2 \
           logical/3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2 \
           split/3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2

To ssh://git.launchpad.net/~kstenerud/ubuntu/+source/at
 * [new tag]         split/3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2 -> split/3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2
 * [new tag]         logical/3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2 -> logical/3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2
 * [new tag]         new/debian -> new/debian
 * [new tag]         old/debian -> old/debian
 * [new tag]         old/ubuntu -> old/ubuntu
 * [new tag]         reconstruct/3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2 -> reconstruct/3.1.20-3.1ubuntu2
```


(merge-create-a-ppa)=
## Create a PPA

You need to have a {term}`PPA` for reviewers to test.


(merge-create-a-ppa-repository)=
### Create a PPA repository

`https://launchpad.net/~<your-username>/+activate-ppa`

Give it a name that identifies the package name, Ubuntu version, and bug number, such as `at-merge-1802914`.

:::{important}
Be sure to enable all architectures to check that it builds (click {guilabel}`Change details` in the top right corner of the newly created PPA page).
:::

The URL of the PPA is formed as follows:

`https://launchpad.net/~<your-username>/+archive/ubuntu/<PPA-name>`

For example:

`https://launchpad.net/~kstenerud/+archive/ubuntu/disco-at-merge-1802914`


(merge-upload-files)=
### Upload files

```none
$ dput ppa:kstenerud/disco-at-merge-1802914 ../at_3.1.23-1ubuntu1_source.changes
```


(merge-wait-for-packages-to-be-ready)=
### Wait for packages to be ready

1. Check the PPA page to see when packages are finished building:

   [`https://launchpad.net/~kstenerud/+archive/ubuntu/disco-at-merge-1802914`](https://launchpad.net/~kstenerud/+archive/ubuntu/disco-at-merge-1802914)

2. Look at the package contents to make sure they have actually been published (click {guilabel}`View package details` in the top right corner of the PPA page, or append `+packages` to its URL):

   [`https://launchpad.net/~kstenerud/+archive/ubuntu/disco-at-merge-1802914/+packages`](https://launchpad.net/~kstenerud/+archive/ubuntu/disco-at-merge-1802914/+packages)

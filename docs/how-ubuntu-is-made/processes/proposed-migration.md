# Proposed migration

Uploads of fixed or merged packages don't automatically get released to Ubuntu
users, but rather go into a special pocket called `-proposed` for testing and
integration. Once a package is deemed OK, it **migrates** into the `-release`
pocket for users to consume. This is called the
["proposed migration" process](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration).

This page documents tips and tricks for solving migration issues, along with
some guidance for people just starting the proposed migration duty.


## Lifecycle for an upload

1. Issue identified, fixed, and packaged

1. `*source.changes` uploaded

1. If the fix is an SRU, or if we're in a {ref}`freeze <feature-freeze>`:

   * Upload goes into an `unapproved` queue

   * SRU team reviews and approves... (go to 4)

   * ...or disapproves (go to 1)

1. Upload goes into `[codename]-proposed` queue

1. Launchpad builds binary package(s) from source package

1. Run [autopkgtests](https://canonical-ubuntu-packaging-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/1.0/explanation/auto-pkg-test.html):

   * Autopkgtests for the package itself

   * Autopkgtests for the reverse{-build}-dependencies, as well

1. Verify other archive consistency checks:

   * Are binary packages installable?

   * Are all required dependencies at the right version?

   * Does it cause anything to become uninstallable?

   * etc.

1. If (and only if) the fix is an SRU:

   * [SRU bug](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/howto/common-issues/)
     updated with request to verify

   * Reporter or developer verifies fix, and updates tags

1. Release package from `[codename]-proposed` to `[codename]`

The migration often proceeds automatically, but when issues arise we need to
step in to sort things out. Sometimes, the problematic package is one we've
uploaded ourselves, and it is generally the responsibility of the uploader to
analyze and solve the issue.

However, there are other situations that can lead to migration trouble, for
which there is no specific responsible party. These types of issues are focused
on as part of the "Plus-One Maintenance" effort, where individuals across the
distro team are tasked with examining and solving them. Some of these problems
arise from items auto-synced from Debian, or via a side-effect of some other
change in the distro.


(pm-update-excuses)=
## Update Excuses page

All current migration issues for the current devel release are displayed on the
[Update Excuses Page](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html).
[Similar pages](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/)
exist for stable releases (these items generally relate to particular SRUs).
These pages are created by a software service named "Britney", which updates
the page after each batch of test runs, typically every 2--3 hours depending on
load.

The page is ordered from newest to oldest, so the items at the top of the page
may still be processing (indicated by "Test in progress" marked for one or more
architectures). In general, two things to watch for are "missing build", which
can indicate a failure to build the source package ({term}`FTBFS`), and "autopkgtest
regression", which indicates a test failure. Both of these situations are
described in more depth below.

Many of the items on the page are not actually broken, they're just blocked by
something else that needs resolving. This often happens for new libraries or
language runtimes, or really any package that a lot of other things depend on
to build, install, or run tests against.

If you are just coming up to speed on proposed migration duty, you'll likely be
wondering "Where do I even start?!". A solid suggestion is to look for build
failures towards the upper-middle of the page, particularly those affecting only
one architecture. Single-arch build failures tend to be more localized and more
deterministic in their cause. Items towards the top of the page (but after all
the "Test in progress" items) are newer, and so have a higher chance of being
something simple that fewer people have looked at yet, without being so new that
it's still being actively worked on by someone.

For tasks like `+1 maintenance` where the goal is to ensure not too much
migration backlog builds up it can be helpful to use
[tools visualizing](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/visualizing-and-exploring-ubuntu-excuses/59824)
the excuses page in different ways.
Such tools can help to unblock a lot with only a few changes - but be careful,
only using such will cause less central cases to get stuck for quite a long
time.

If you want to double check whether someone is already looking at it, the
[Ubuntu Devel Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#devel:ubuntu.com) is a
good place to ask. For any case that requires more effort or a deeper analysis
an {ref}`update-excuses bug <pm-bug-reports-for-migration-problems>` will help to
coordinate.

On the other hand, all these are good hints but you don't have to worry or feel
blocked too much about where to start; the Update Excuses page is like a wool
sweater in that whichever thread you start pulling, you'll end up unraveling
the whole affair.


(pm-bug-reports-for-migration-problems)=
## Bug reports for migration problems

If you file a bug report about a build or test failure shown on the Update
Excuses page, tag the bug report `update-excuse`. Britney will include a link
to the bug report next time it refreshes the `update_excuses.html` page. This
helps other developers see the investigative work you've already done, and can
be used to identify the next action. Mark yourself as the *Assignee* if you're
actively working on the issue, and leave the bug unsubscribed if you aren't, so
that others can carry things forward.


(pm-failure-to-build-from-source)=
## Failure to Build From Source (FTBFS)

The build step can hit failures for several general classes of problems.

* {ref}`First <pm-normal-build-issues>` are regular build problems that can be
  easily reproduced locally (and that should have been addressed before
  uploading).

* {ref}`Second <pm-platform-specific-issues>` are platform-specific issues that
  may have been overlooked due to being present only on unfamiliar hardware.

* {ref}`Third <pm-intermittent-problems>` are intermittent network or framework
  problems, where simply retrying the build once or twice can result in a
  successful build.

* {ref}`Fourth <pm-dependency-problems>` are dependency problems, where the
  task is to get some other package to be the right version in the `-release`
  pocket so that the build will succeed.

* {ref}`Fifth <pm-abi-changes>` are {term}`ABI` changes with dependencies;
  these often just need a no-change rebuild.

* {ref}`Sixth <pm-package-specific-issues>` (and finally) are all the other
  myriad package-specific build problems that usually require a tweak to the
  package itself.


(pm-normal-build-issues)=
### Normal build issues

The first case covers all the usual normal build issues like syntax errors and
so on. In practice these tend to be quite rare, since developers tend to be
very diligent in making sure their packages build before uploading them. Fixes
for these is standard development work.


(pm-platform-specific-issues)=
### Platform-specific issues

The second case is similar to the first but pertains to issues that arise only
on specific platforms. Common situations are tests or code that relies on
[endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) of data types, and so
breaks on big-endian systems (e.g. s390x), code expecting 64-bit data types that
breaks on 32-bit (e.g. armhf), and so on.
[Canonistack provides hardware](https://wiki.canonical.com/InformationInfrastructure/IS/CanoniStack-BOS01)
for Canonical employees to use to try and reproduce these problems.

```{note}

i386 in particular fails less due to data type issues, but more because it is
a partial port and has numerous limitations that require special handling, as
described on the {ref}`i386 troubleshooting page <aa-i386>`.
```


(pm-intermittent-problems)=
### Intermittent problems

In the third case, local building was fine but the uploaded build may have
failed on Launchpad due to a transitory issue such as a network outage, or a
race condition, or other stressed resource. Alternatively, it might have failed
due to a strange dependence on some variable like the day of the week.

In these cases, clicking on the "Retry Build" button in Launchpad once or twice
can sometimes cause the build to randomly succeed, thus allowing the transition
to proceed (if you're not yet a Core Dev, ask for a Core Dev on the
`#ubuntu-devel` IRC channel to click the link for you).

Needless to say, we want the build process to be robust and predictable. If the
problem is a recurring one, and you are able to narrow down the cause, it can
be worthwhile to find the root cause and figure out how to fix it properly.


(pm-dependency-problems)=
### Dependency problems

For the fourth case, where a dependency is not the right version or is not
present in the right pocket, the question becomes one of identifying what's
wrong with the dependency and fixing it.

Be aware there may be some situations where the problem really is with the
dependency itself. The solution then might be to change the version of the
dependency, or adjust the dependency version requirement, or remove invalid
binary packages, or so forth. The latter solutions often require asking an
Archive Admin for help on the `#ubuntu-release` IRC channel.


(pm-abi-changes)=
### ABI changes

The fifth case, of ABI changes, tends to come up when Ubuntu is introducing new
versions of toolchains, language runtime environments or core libraries (i.e.
new `glibc`, `gcc`, `glib2.0`, `ruby`, `python3`, `phpunit`, etc).

This happens when the release of the underlying libraries/toolchains is newer
than the project that uses it. Your package may fail to build because, for
example, one of its dependencies was built against a different version of
`glibc`, or with less strict `gcc` options (the
[Ubuntu Defaults](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ToolChain/CompilerFlags#Notes) can be
checked here) etc, and it needs a (no-change) rebuild (and/or patched) to build
with the new version or stricter options.

Assuming the upstream project has already adapted to the changed behavior or
function-prototypes **and** produced a release, then:

* If we already have the release in Ubuntu a simple no-change rebuild may
  suffice.

* If we don't have the release, then it will need a sync or merge, or patching
  in the changes to what we're carrying.
  
If upstream has not *released* the changes, then you could also consider
packaging a snapshot of their git repository.

If upstream has *not yet made* the changes, and there no existing bug reports or
pull requests yet, it may be necessary to make the changes on our end.
Communication with Debian and upstream can be effective here, and where it
isn't, filing bug reports can be worth the effort.

It's worth noting that with ABI changes, these updates often cause the same kind
of errors in many places. It's worth asking in the `#ubuntu-devel` IRC channel
in case standard solutions are already known that you can re-use, such as
ignoring a new warning via a `-W...` option or switching to the old behavior
via a `-f...` option. It's also worth reporting your findings in ways others can
easily re-use when they run into more cases.


(pm-package-specific-issues)=
### Package-specific issues

Finally, there are a myriad of other problems that can result in build
failures. Many of these will be package-specific or situation-specific. As you
run into situations that crop up more frequently than a couple of times please
update these docs.


(pm-autopkgtest-regressions)=
## Autopkgtest regressions

After a package has successfully built, the
[autopkgtest infrastructure](https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/) will run its
[DEP8 tests](https://canonical-ubuntu-packaging-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/1.0/explanation/auto-pkg-test.html)
for each of its supported architectures. Failed tests can block the migration,
and "Regression" listed for the failed architecture(s), worded in one of the
following ways.


### "Migration status for `aaa (x to y): <reason>`"

This means package `aaa` has a new version `y` uploaded to `-proposed`, to
replace the existing version `x`, but the change has not yet been permitted.
The various reasons typically seen are outlined in the items below.


### "Waiting for test results, another package or too young (no action required now - check later)"

This means one or more tests still need to be run. These will be noted as 'Test
in progress' under the 'Issues preventing migration' line item.


### "Will attempt migration (Any information below is purely informational)"

This is good -- it indicates the item is currently in process and will likely
migrate soon (within a day or so).


### "Waiting for another item to be ready to migrate (no action required now - check later)"

This can be good if it's recent, but if it's more than a few days old then there
may be a deeper issue going on with a dependency. If it's recent, just give it
some time (maybe a day or so). If it's older, refer to the items listed under
the 'Issues preventing migration:' line to see what specifically has gone wrong,
and then see the {ref}`pm-issues-preventing-migration` section for diagnostic tips.


### "BLOCKED: Cannot migrate due to another item, which is blocked (please check which dependencies are stuck)"

The package itself is likely fine, but it's being blocked by some issue with
some other package. Check beneath the 'Invalidated by dependency' line to see
what package(s) need attention.


### "BLOCKED: Maybe temporary, maybe blocked but Britney is missing information (check below)"

One situation where this can occur is if one of the package's dependencies is
failing to build, which will be indicated by a line stating "`missing build on
<arch>`". Once the dependency's build failure is resolved, this package should
migrate successfully; if it doesn't migrate within a day or so, a re-trigger may
be needed.


### "BLOCKED: Rejected/violates migration policy/introduces a regression"

This indicates an "Autopkgtest Regression" with the given package, and is by far
the most common situation where your attention will be required. A typical
result will look something like:

> autopkgtest for [package]/[version]: amd64: <span style="background-color:darkred">Regression</span>, arm64: <span style="background-color:yellow">Not a regression</span>, armhf: <span style="background-color:green">Pass</span>, ppc64el: <span style="background-color:#99DDFF">Test in progress</span>, ...

The 'Regression' items indicate problems needing to be solved. See the
{ref}`pm-issues-preventing-migration` section for diagnostic tips.

Sometimes you'll see lines where all the tests have passed (or, at least, none
are marked Regression). Passing packages are usually not shown. When they *are*
shown, it generally means that the test ran against an outdated version of the
dependency. For example, you may see:

```none
* python3-defaults (3.10.1-0ubuntu1 to 3.10.1-0ubuntu2)
    - Migration status for python3-defaults (3.10.1-0ubuntu1 to 3.10.1-0ubuntu2): BLOCKED: Rejected/violates migration policy/introduces a regression
    - Issues preventing migration:
    - ...
    - autopkgtest for netplan.io/0.104-0ubuntu1: amd64: Pass, arm64: Pass, armhf: Pass, ppc64el: Pass, s390x: Pass.
    - ...
```

In this case, check `rmadison`:

```none
$ rmad netplan.io
netplan.io | 0.103-0ubuntu7   | impish
netplan.io | 0.104-0ubuntu2   | jammy

netplan.io | 0.103-3       | unstable
```

We can see our test ran against version `0.104-0ubuntu1`, but a newer version
(`0.104-0ubuntu2`) is in the archive. If we look at the autopkgtest summary page
for one of the architectures, we see:

```none
## https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/packages/n/netplan.io/jammy/amd64
0.104-0ubuntu2    netplan.io/0.104-0ubuntu2   2022-03-10 11:38:36 UTC     1h 01m 59s  -   pass    log   artifacts
...
0.104-0ubuntu1    python3-defaults/3.10.1-0ubuntu2    2022-03-08 04:26:47 UTC     0h 44m 47s  -   pass    log   artifacts  
...
```

Notice that version `0.104-0ubuntu1` was triggered against the `python3`-defaults
version currently in `-proposed`, but version `0.104-0ubuntu2` was only run
against `netplan.io` itself, and thus ran against the old `python3`-defaults. We
need to have a test run against both these new versions (and against any other
of `netplan.io`'s dependencies also in `-proposed`.)

The ['excuses-kicker' tool](https://code.launchpad.net/~bryce/+git/excuses-kicker)
is a convenient way to generate the re-trigger URLs:

```none
$ excuses-kicker netplan.io
https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/request.cgi?release=jammy&arch=amd64&package=netplan.io&trigger=netplan.io%2F0.104-0ubuntu2&trigger=symfony%2F5.4.4%2Bdfsg-1ubuntu7&trigger=pandas%2F1.3.5%2Bdfsg-3&trigger=babl%2F1%3A0.1.90-1&trigger=python3-defaults%2F3.10.1-0ubuntu2&trigger=php-nesbot-carbon%2F2.55.2-1
...
```

Notice how it's picked up not only `python3`-defaults but also several additional
packages that `netplan.io` has been run against in the recent past. These aren't
necessarily direct dependencies for `netplan.io`, but serve as an informed guess.


(pm-issues-preventing-migration)=
## Issues preventing migration

Packages can fail to migrate for a vast number of different reasons. Sometimes
the clues listed under the 'Issues preventing migration:" line item on the
'update_excuses' page will be enough to indicate the next action needed; that
will be the focus of this section. In other cases, the autopkgtest log file will
need to be analyzed; that is covered in a later section.


(pm-main-universe-binary-mismatch)=
### A `main`/`universe` binary mismatch

A given source package may have some binaries in `main` and others in `universe`,
but this can get mixed up for various reasons. This genre of issues, known as
["component mismatches"](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/component-mismatches.txt)
is spotted from migration excuses like:

```none
"php8.1-dba/amd64 in main cannot depend on libqdbm14 in universe"
```

Check the prior release to see if `php8.1-dba` and `libqdbm14` were both in
`main`, or both in `universe`. If both were in `universe` before, then most likely the
package in `main` needs to be demoted to `universe`. Ask an Archive Admin to do
this, and/or file a bug report (for an example, see
[LP: #1962491](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/php8.1/+bug/1962491)).

Conversely, if the dependency in `universe` actually needs to be in `main`, for
example a newly introduced binary package, then a 'Main Inclusion Request' (MIR)
bug report will need to be filed. See {ref}`main-inclusion-review` for details
on this procedure.

If both packages were previously in `main`, then some additional investigation
should be done to see why the `universe` package was moved out of `main`. The
resolution may be to move one or the other package so they're both in the same
pocket, or find a way to remove the dependency between them.

One very special case of these is unintended dependencies due to extra-includes.
Be aware that while most dependencies seem obvious (seeds --> packages -->
packages) there is an aspect of
[germinate](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/germinate-output/ubuntu.jammy/all)
which will
[automatically include](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/ubuntu/tree/supported#n124)
all `-dbg`, `-dev`, `-doc*` packages in a source archive that is in main. In
germinate these will appear as `Rescued from <src>`. If a merge is affected,
the solution without adding delta usually is to add an `Extra-exclude` like in
this [example with `net-snmp`](https://code.launchpad.net/~sergiodj/ubuntu-seeds/+git/ubuntu/+merge/414063).

For more information on component mismatches, from an Archive Administration
perspective, see {ref}`aa-package-overrides`.


(pm-impossible-depends)=
### Impossible depends

An excuse like this:

```none
"Impossible Depends: aaa -> bbb/x/<arch>"
```

means package `aaa` has a dependency on package `bbb`, version `x`, for
architecture `<arch>`, but it is not possible to satisfy this.

One reason this can occur is if the package `bbb` is in `universe` whereas `aaa`
is in `main`. It may be that some of package `aaa`'s binaries need to be moved
to `universe`. See {ref}`pm-main-universe-binary-mismatch` for directions.


(pm-migrating-makes-something-uninstallable)=
### Migrating makes something uninstallable

A migration excuse in this format:

```none
"migrating [aaa]/[aaa-new-version]/[arch] to testing makes [bbb]/[bbb-version]/[arch] uninstallable"
```

means that package `bbb` has a versioned build dependency against the old
version of package `aaa`. A no-change rebuild can be used in these cases to
force a rebuild.


### Depends: `aaa [bbb]` (not considered)

Package `aaa` is blocked because it depends on `bbb`, however `bbb` is either
invalid or rejected.

If the dependency itself is not valid, this line will be followed by an
'Invalidated by dependency' line. In this case, look at the situation with
package `bbb` and resolve that first, in order to move package `aaa` forward.

If there is no 'Invalidated by dependency' line, then the dependency may be
rejected. There are three reasons why a rejection can occur:

1. it needs approval, 
2. cannot determine if permanent, or
3. permanent rejection.


### Implicit dependency: `aaa [bbb]`

An implicit dependency is a pseudo dependency where Breaks/Conflicts creates an
inverted dependency. For example, `pkg-b` Depends on `pkg-a`, but `pkg-a=2.0-1`
breaks `pkg-b=1.0-1`, so `pkg-b=2.0-1` must migrate first (or they must migrate
together). A way to handle this is to re-run `pkg-b`'s autopkgtest (for 2.0-1)
and include a trigger for `pkg-a=2.0`. For example, run:

```bash
$ excuses-kicker -t pkg-a pkg-b
```

This can also occur if `pkg-b` has "Depends: pkg-a (<< 2.0)", due to the use of
some non-stable internal interface.

It can also occur if `pkg-a` has a Provides that changes from 1.0-1 to 2.0-1,
but `pkg-b` has a Depends on the earlier version.


### Implicit dependency: `aaa [bbb]` (not considered)

Similar to above, `aaa` and `bbb` are intertwined, but `bbb` is also either
invalid or rejected. For these cases, attention should first be paid to
resolving the issue(s) for `bbb`, and then re-running the autopkgtest for it
with a trigger included against package `aaa`.


### Has no binaries on arch `<arch>`

Usually this means the package has either failed to build or failed to upload
the binaries for a build. Refer to the
{ref}`failed to build from source <pm-failure-to-build-from-source>` section for
tips on how to handle this class of problem.


### Has no binaries on any arch (`- to x.y.z`)

If the package doesn't have a current version, this error can indicate the
package is not (yet) in the Archive, or it can mean its binaries were removed
previously but not sync-blocklisted and thus reappeared.

If the package should not be synced into the Archive, on `#ubuntu-release` ping
`ubuntu-archive` with a request to remove the packages' binaries and add them to
[sync-blocklist.txt](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/sync-blocklist.txt).

Otherwise, there are several things worth checking. Note that these links are
for Jammy; modify them for the current development release:

- [Stuck in New queue](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/jammy/+queue?queue_state=0)
- [Stuck in Unapproved queue](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/jammy/+queue?queue_state=1)


### No reason - still stuck?

If the package, as shown in
[excuses](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html),
looks good but is not migrating, it might mean an installability conflict.
So, do not be confused by the status "Will attempt migration (Any information
below is purely informational)" - there are more checks happening afterwards.
This is checked and reported in
[update output.txt](https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_output.txt)

Here is an example of `exim4` meeting this situation:

```none
trying: exim4
skipped: exim4 (4, 0, 137)
    got: 11+0: a-0:a-0:a-0:i-2:p-1:r-7:s-1
    * riscv64: sa-exim
```

That output is hard to read
([as explained here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration#The_update_output.txt_file_is_completely_unreadable.21)),
but in this example it means that a few packages on those architectures became
uninstallable.

You can usually reproduce that in a `-proposed`-enabled container and in this
example we see:

```none
root@k:~# apt install exim4 sa-exim
...
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 sa-exim : Depends: exim4-localscanapi-4.1
```

Now we know that, let us compare the old and new `exim4`, which has:

```none
root@k:~# apt-cache show exim4-daemon-light | grep -e scanapi -e '^Versi'
Version: 4.96-3ubuntu1
Provides: exim4-localscanapi-6.0, mail-transport-agent
Version: 4.95-4ubuntu3
Provides: exim4-localscanapi-4.1, mail-transport-agent
```

So our example needs (as is most often the solution in these cases) a no-change
rebuild to pick up the new dependency. After a test build to be sure it works,
you can often upload and resolve this situation.


(pm-autopkgtest-log-files)=
## Autopkgtest log files

You can view the recent test run history for a package's architecture by
clicking on the respective architecture's name.

Tests can fail for many reasons.

Flaky tests, hardware instabilities, and intermittent network issues can cause
false positive failures. Re-triggering the test run (via the '♻' symbol) is
typically all that's needed to resolve these. Before doing this, it is
worthwhile to check the recent test run history to see if someone else has
already tried doing that.

When examining a failed autopkgtest's log, start from the end of the file,
which will usually either show a summary of the test runs, or an error message
if a fault was hit. For example:

```none
done.
done.
(Reading database ... 50576 files and directories currently installed.)
Removing autopkgtest-satdep (0) ...
autopkgtest [21:40:55]: test command1: true
autopkgtest [21:40:55]: test command1: [-----------------------
autopkgtest [21:40:58]: test command1: -----------------------]
command1             PASS
autopkgtest [21:41:03]: test command1:  - - - - - - - - - - results - - - - - - - - - -
autopkgtest [21:41:09]: @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ summary
master-cron-systemd  FAIL non-zero exit status 1
master-cgi-systemd   PASS
node-systemd         PASS
command1             PASS
```

Here we see that the test named `master-cron-systemd` has failed. To see why it
failed, do a search on the page for `master-cron-systemd`, and iterate until
you get to the last line of the test run, then scroll up to find the failed test
cases:

```none
autopkgtest [21:23:39]: test master-cron-systemd: preparing testbed
...
...
autopkgtest [21:25:10]: test master-cron-systemd: [-----------------------
...

...
...
autopkgtest [21:25:41]: test master-cron-systemd: -----------------------]

rm: cannot remove '/var/cache/munin/www/localdomain/localhost.localdomain': Directory not empty
```

All autopkgtests follow this general format, although the output from the tests
themselves varies widely.

Beyond "regular" test case failures like this one, autopkgtest failures can also
occur due to missing or incorrect dependencies, test framework timeouts, and
other issues. Each of these is discussed in more detail below.


### Flaky or actually regressed in release

Tests might break due to the changes we applied -- catching those is the reason
the tests exist in the first place. But sometimes the tests do fail but are not
flaky. In that case, it is often another unrelated change to the test
environment that made it suddenly break permanently.

If you have checked the recent test run history as suggested above and have
retried the tests often enough that it seems unreasonable to continue retrying,
then you might want to tell the autopkgtest infrastructure that it shouldn't
expect this test to pass.

This can now be done via a migration-reference run. To do that, open the same
URL you'd normally use to re-run the test, but instead of `package` + `version`
as the trigger, you would add `migration-reference/0`. This is a special key,
which will re-run the test without any special packages, just as it is in the
target release.

For example:

```none
https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/request.cgi?release=RELEASE&arch=ARCH&package=SRCPKG&trigger=migration-reference/0
```

If this fails too, it will update the expectations so that if other packages are
trying to migrate they will not be required to pass.

If this does not fail, then your assumption that your upload/change wasn't
related to the failure is most likely wrong.

More details about that can be found in the
[How to run autopkgtests of a package against the version in the release pocket](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration#How_to_run_autopkgtests_of_a_package_against_the_version_in_the_release_pocket).

## Special cases


### Circular build dependencies

When two or more packages have new versions that depend on each other's new
versions in order to build, this can lead to a
[circular build dependency](https://wiki.debian.org/CircularBuildDependencies).
There are a few different ways these come into being, which have unique
characteristics that can help find a way to work through them.


#### 1. Build-dependencies for test suites

If package A's build process invokes a test suite as part of the build (i.e. in
`debian/rules` under `override_dh_auto_test`), and the test suite requires
package B, then if package B requires package A to build, this creates a
situation where neither package will successfully build.

The workaround in this case is to (temporarily) disable running the test suite
during a build. This is usually OK when the package's autopkgtests (defined in
`debian/tests/control`) also run the test suite. For instance:

```none
override_dh_auto_test:
    echo "Disabled: phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php"
```

You may also need to delete test dependencies from `debian/control`, and/or move
them to `debian/tests/control`.

With package A's test suite thus disabled during build, it will build
successfully but then fail its autopkgtest run. Next, from package B's Launchpad
page, request rebuilds for each binary in a failed state. Once package B has
successfully built on all supported architectures, package A's autopkgtests can
be re-run using package B as a trigger.

Once everything's migrated successfully, a clean-up step would be to re-enable
package A's test suite and verify that it now passes.


#### 2. Bootstrapping

In this situation, packages A-1.0 and B-1.0 are in the archive. We're
introducing new versions A-3.0 and B-3.0 (skipping 2.0); A-3.0 depends on B-3.0,
and B-3.0 requires A-2.0 or newer. Both A-3.0 and B-3.0 will fail to build.

One example of where this can occur is if code common to both A and B is
refactored out to a new binary package that is provided in A starting at
version 2.0.

The most straightforward solution to this situation is to ask an Archive Admin
to delete both A-3.0 and B-3.0 from the Archive, then upload version A-2.0 and
allow it to build (and ideally migrate). Next reintroduce B-3.0, and then once
that's built, do the same for A-3.0.

With even larger version jumps, e.g. from A-1.0 to A-5.0, it may be necessary to
do multiple bootstraps, along with some experimentation to see which
intermediate version(s) need to be jumped to. Another common complication can be
where the cycle involves more than two packages.


### Test dependency irregularities

The package's `debian/tests/control` file
[defines what gets installed](https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/autopkgtest/blob/master/doc/README.package-tests.rst)
in the test environment before executing the tests. You can review and verify
the packages and versions in the DEP-8 test log, between the lines
"`autopkgtest...: test integration: preparing testbed`" and
"`Removing autopkgtest-satdep`".

A common issue is that the test should be run against a version of a dependency
present in the `-proposed` pocket, however it failed due to running against the
version in `-release`. Often this is straightforward to prove by running the
autopkgtests locally in a container.

Another easy way to test this is to re-run the test but set it to preferentially
pull packages from `-proposed` -- this is done by appending `&all-proposed=1` to
the test URL. If that passes, but the package still does not migrate, then look
in the test log for all packages that were pulled from `-proposed` and include
those as triggers.
[Excuses Kicker](https://git.launchpad.net/~bryce/+git/excuses-kicker) and
[retry-autopkgtest-regressions](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-archive-tools/tree/retry-autopkgtest-regressions)
are handy tools for generating these URLs.

As with rebuilds, these re-triggers also require Core Dev permissions, so if
you're not yet a Core Dev give the links to someone who is for assistance.


### Test framework timeouts and out of memory

The autopkgtest framework will kill tests that take too long to run. In some
cases it makes sense to just configure autopkgtest to let the test run longer.
This is done by setting the `long_tests` option. Similarly, some tests may need
more CPU or memory than in a standard worker. The `big_packages` option directs
autopkgtest to run these on workers with more CPU and memory. Both these options
are explained on the
[Proposed Migration wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration#autopkgtests)
page.

It is worthwhile to mention that Debian test sizing is currently (as of 2021)
equivalent to our `big_packages`.

The configuration that associates source packages to either `big_packages` /
`long_tests` and the actual deployment code was recently split.
[The new docs](https://autopkgtest-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/administration.html#give-a-package-more-time-or-more-resources)
explain this and
[link to a repository](https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-release/autopkgtest-cloud/+git/autopkgtest-package-configs)
which can now be merged by any Release Team member.


### Disabling / skipping tests

While (ideally) failing tests should receive fixes to enable them to pass
properly, sometimes this is not feasible or possible. In such extreme situations
it may be necessary to explicitly disable a test case or an entire test suite.
For instance, if an unimportant package's test failure blocks a more important
package from transitioning.

As a general rule, try to be as surgical as possible and avoid disabling more
than is absolutely required. For example, if a test has 10 sub-cases and only
one sub-case fails, prefer to comment out or delete that sub-case rather than
the entire test.

There is no single method to disabling tests, unfortunately, since different
programming languages take different design approaches for their test harnesses.
Some test harnesses have provisions for marking tests "SKIP". In other
situations it may be cleaner to add a Debian patch that simply deletes the
test's code from the codebase. Sometimes it works best to insert an early return
with a fake PASS in the particular code path that broke.

Take care, when disabling a test, to include a detailed enough explanation as to
why you're disabling it, which will inform a future packager when the test can
be re-enabled. For instance, if a proper fix will be available in a future
release, say so and indicate which version will have it. Or, if the test is
being disabled just to get another package to transition, indicate what that
package's name and expected version are. Bug reports, DEP-3 comments, and
changelog entries can be good places to document these clues.


### Disabling / skipping / customizing tests for certain architectures

If you need to disable the entire test suite for a specific architecture, such as
an arch that upstream doesn't include in their CI testing, and that sees
frequent / ample failures on our end, then you can skip the testing via checks
in the `debian/rules` file. For example (from `util-linux-2.34`):

```none
override_dh_auto_test:
ifneq (,$(filter alpha armel armhf arm64,$(DEB_HOST_ARCH)))
        @echo "WARNING: Making tests non-fatal because of arch $(DEB_HOST_ARCH)"
        dh_auto_test --max-parallel=1 || true
else ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS), linux)
        dh_auto_test --max-parallel=1
endif
```

If the issue is the integer type size, here's a way to filter based on that
(from `mash-2.2.2+dfsg`):

```none
override_dh_auto_test:
ifeq (,$(filter nocheck,$(DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS)))
ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH_BITS),32)
        echo "Do not test for 32 bit archs since test results were calculated for 64 bit."
else
        dh_auto_test --no-parallel
endif
endif
```

Or based on the CPU type itself (from `containerd-1.3.3-0ubuntu2.1`):

```none
override_dh_auto_test:
ifneq (arm, $(DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU)) # skip the tests on armhf ("--- FAIL: TestParseSelector/linux (0.00s)  platforms_test.go:292: arm support not fully implemented: not implemented")
        cd '$(OUR_GOPATH)/src/github.com/containerd/containerd' && make test
endif
```


### Skipping autopkgtesting entirely

If an autopkgtest is badly written, it may be too challenging to get it to pass.
In these extreme cases, it's possible to request that test failures be ignored
for the sake of package migration.

File an MP against it with a description indicating the Launchpad bug #, the rationale
for why the test can and should be skipped, and an explanation of what will be
unblocked in the migration.

Reviewers should be `canonical-<your-team>` (e.g. `canonical-server-reporter`
for Server team members), `ubuntu-release`, and any Archive Admins or
Foundations team members you've discussed the issue with.


## Other common issues

Autopkgtest runs tests in a controlled network environment, so if a test case
expects to download material from the internet, it will likely fail. If the test
case is attempting to download a dependency (e.g. via PIP or Maven), sometimes
this can be worked around by adding the missing dependency to
`debian/tests/control`. If it is attempting to download an example file, then it
may be possible to make the test case use a local file, or to load from the
proxy network.


(pm-triggering-tests-from-the-cli)=
## Triggering tests from the CLI

There will be times when you may need to (re-)trigger several tests at once. In
such situations, opening the autopkgtest trigger URLs in a browser becomes a
repetitive, time-consuming mechanical task. We could still use the CLI to feed
the URLs to a browser, but this would still be error prone and time consuming
depending on the number of trigger URLs we are dealing with.

Instead of using a browser to trigger our tests, we could perform the HTTP
requests through the CLI. However, since the autopkgtest requires
authentication, we need to extract our credentials from a browser.

```{warning}

The steps below are to extract your credentials for the
autopkgtest infrastructure from the browser. Make sure to secure those
credentials and not to share them.
```

The credentials are available in a cookie for `autopkgtest.ubuntu.com`. There are
two values we want to extract there: the `session` and the `SRVNAME`.

There are different ways to extract those credentials from the browser, here,
we show how to do it for Firefox using the Firefox Developer Tools menu.

In Firefox, browse to
[`autopkgtest.ubuntu.com`](https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/) and open the
Developer Tools (by pressing {kbd}`F12` or {kbd}`Ctrl` + {kbd}`Shift` + {kbd}`C`).
In the {guilabel}`Storage` tab, expand the {guilabel}`Cookies` menu on the left
panel and look for an `autopkgtest.ubuntu.com` entry. There you should find the
values for the `session` and `SRVNAME` entries mentioned above.

Save those values in a local file (e.g., `~/.cache/autopkgtest.cookie`) with
the following contents:

```none
autopkgtest.ubuntu.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	0	session	YOUR_COOKIE_SESSION_VALUE_HERE
autopkgtest.ubuntu.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	0	SRVNAME	YOUR_COOKIE_SRVNAME_VALUE_HERE
```

Make sure the file has proper permissions so other users cannot read it, e.g.,
`0600`, **it will carry your autopkgtest infrastructure credentials**.

Note that the delimiters used above are tabs (`\t`) and not spaces. You can use
the following commands to ensure your cookie file has the proper format:

```none
$ printf "autopkgtest.ubuntu.com\\tTRUE\\t/\\tTRUE\\t0\\tsession\\tYOUR_COOKIE_SESSION_VALUE_HERE\\n" > ~/.cache/autopkgtest.cookie
$ printf "autopkgtest.ubuntu.com\\tTRUE\\t/\\tTRUE\\t0\\tSRVNAME\\tYOUR_COOKIE_SRVNAME_VALUE_HERE\\n" >> ~/.cache/autopkgtest.cookie
```

You can now use `curl` to trigger the autopkgtest URLs (e.g., `curl --cookie
~/.cache/autopkgtest.cookie URL`). If you have a long list of test trigger
URLs, you can trigger them all with:

```none
$ cat TEST_URL_LIST | vipe | xargs -rn1 -P10 curl --cookie ~/.cache/autopkgtest.cookie -o /dev/null --silent --head --write-out '%{url_effective} : %{http_code}\\n'
```

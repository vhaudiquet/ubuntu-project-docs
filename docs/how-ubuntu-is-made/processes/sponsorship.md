# Sponsorship

Ubuntu encourages contributions from any person in the wider community. However, direct uploading to the {term}`Ubuntu Archive` is restricted.

Sponsorship is a process that allows developers who don't have upload rights to submit their {term}`patches <patch>`, {term}`merge proposals <merge proposal>`, new packages, or sync requests for review. If approved, an authorized developer (their **sponsor**) uploads the changes or initiates the sync on their behalf.

The article series provides guidance on requesting sponsorship and sponsoring.

## Who are sponsors

Sponsors are contributors with proven packaging skills who have gained upload rights for a particular package set or area of the Archive. There are three categories of upload rights:

* {ref}`certain sets of packages <dmb-joining-packageset>`
* {ref}`all universe packages <dmb-joining-MOTU>`
* {ref}`the full Archive <dmb-joining-core-dev>`

:::{note}
Canonical employees are treated no differently than general community members and must follow the same processes for gaining upload rights.

## Tracking for endorsements

Keep notes of:

* Who has [sponsored for you](https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi).
* Which package(s) they sponsored.
* What team or part of the distribution they work on.

These notes are helpful both for finding sponsors in the future and for endorsersments on your future {ref}`applications for upload rights <path-to-upload-rights>`.

(version-strings)=
# Version string format

Choosing the {manpage}`appropriate version <deb-version(7)>` can be complex
since there are numerous conditions to consider. The following paragraphs first
provide links to essential foundational information, shared with Debian.

Subsequently, each paragraph addresses specific scenarios that may arise when
uploading to Ubuntu.


## Testing

To test the ordering of your constructed version, use `dpkg`. Available comparisons are: `lt` `le` `eq` `ne` `ge` `gt`.

```console
$ dpkg --compare-versions 1.2.3-3ubuntu1 lt 1.2.4-2ubuntu2   && echo true || echo false
```


## The Version field

Since Ubuntu's versioning specifics are derived from Debian, it is beneficial to
begin by thoroughly reviewing the
[Debian control field "Version"](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#version)
to understand the foundational principles.
The key takeaway is that Debian versions are formatted as:

```none
[upstream_version]-[debian_revision]
```

using the `-` to split the upstream version from the Debian packaging revision.

When we modify a package compared to what's shipped by Debian, we indicate the
change by adding 'ubuntu' to the Debian revision.

One can think of an Ubuntu version number as consisting of three components:

```none
[upstream_version]-[debian_revision_component]ubuntu[ubuntu_revision_component]
```

The `ubuntu` string then marks that whatever follows it is related to changes
added in Ubuntu (`ubuntu` isn't the only string used here, but more on that
shortly).

This distinction allows each party involved in providing a package to the users
-- Upstream, Debian and Ubuntu -- to modify and iterate on their section of the
version number without interfering with others.

When everyone abides by these conventions we can guarantee package upgradability,
but also allow that one can understand some of the package history by just
looking at the package version.


(version-adding-a-change-in-the-current-ubuntu-development-release)=
## Version: Adding a change in the current Ubuntu development release

As shown above, `[upstream_version]-[debian_revision]ubuntu[ubuntu_revision]` is
the basic pattern. Changes within the development release require adding or
incrementing the number immediately following the `ubuntu` string.

Consequently, the first Ubuntu modification would have `ubuntu1` appended to the
Debian revision. Subsequent Ubuntu changes would increment this suffix, i.e.
`ubuntu1 --> ubuntu2`.

> Example one: Adding a change to `2.0-2` in the Ubuntu development release will use `2.0-2ubuntu1`

> Example two: Adding another change to `2.0-2ubuntu1` in the Ubuntu development release will use `2.0-2ubuntu2`

As alluded to earlier, there are a number of special cases, and situations where
we use a string other than `ubuntu` in Ubuntu version numbers.

One such case is `build`, typically used for
{ref}`no-change rebuilds <version-no-change-rebuilds>` that will be discussed
in more depth below. The key thing to know when incrementing from a `buildN` is
that the package is considered unchanged from the Debian revision component, and
incremented as a *new* Ubuntu change.

Here's a listing of examples of the application of these rules:

| Previous version | Modification type | Recommended version |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `2.0-2`          | Ubuntu change     | `2.0-2ubuntu1`      |
| `2.0-2ubuntu1`   | Ubuntu change     | `2.0-2ubuntu2`      |
| `2.0-2ubuntu2`   | Ubuntu change     | `2.0-2ubuntu3`      |
| `2.0-3`          | Re-Sync w/ Debian | `2.0-3`             |
| `2.0-3`          | No-change rebuild | `2.0-3build1`       |
| `2.0-3build1`    | No-change rebuild | `2.0-3build2`       |
| `2.0-3build2`    | Ubuntu change     | `2.0-3ubuntu1`      |

While these examples cover common scenarios, it's important to note that they
apply specifically to the current Ubuntu development release. Stable releases
have different policies, but first we'll explore some special cases for
development releases.


(version-syncing-from-debian)=
## Version: Syncing from Debian

Sometimes the desired change has already been packaged by Debian in a newer
version of the package. During the Ubuntu development cycle, the Archive tooling
automatically copies or {ref}`"syncs" <sync-process>` new package versions from
Debian.

Only packages with no Ubuntu modifications or those with no-change updates
(i.e., versions with `build` rather than `ubuntu` in the revision), are
automatically synced.

If these updates pass Ubuntu's automated testing, they do not require manual
intervention. However, there are scenarios where the automation cannot handle
the process.

First, once the development release reaches
[Debian import freeze](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebianImportFreeze), the sync
automation is disabled.

Therefore, if an update from Debian *is* required, it must be
{ref}`manually synced <sync-process>`. Version numbering in this case is
trivial: It's the exact same version as in Debian.

A second case is when the package does have Ubuntu changes, but our
modifications no longer need to be carried as Ubuntu delta with the new Debian
package.

For example, perhaps the Ubuntu changes were cherry-picked patches from upstream
that are now available in a newer release now available from Debian,
or perhaps Debian has adopted all of the Ubuntu changes into their own packaging.
These situations will also require a {ref}`manual re-sync with Debian <sync-process>`.
The version number also remains identical to Debian (see the 'Re-Sync w/ Debian'
example in the previous section).


(version-no-change-rebuilds)=
## Version: No-change Rebuilds

Sometimes a package has previously successfully synced into Ubuntu, and still
does not require changes to the packaging or source code, but the generated
binaries *do* require rebuilding against newer versions of dependencies.

A common example of this is a library being updated to a newer {term}`ABI`, such
that a package depending on it needs to be re-linked to continue functioning
properly. The process of updating packages dependent on a changed library like
this is called a {ref}`transition <transitions>`.

Rebuilding is not considered a change that should prevent future syncing, so in
this special case one would:

* Not add `ubuntuX` and instead add a `buildX` suffix

* If there is already one such `buildX` suffix present, increment it

* If there is already an `ubuntuX` suffix there would be no auto-sync anyway,
  so increment the existing suffix

So far it is weakly defined if a no change rebuild for
{ref}`native packages <version-native-packages>` shall be a version increment
or adding a `buildX` suffix.

Both styles are present in the Archive and both will work just fine.
Until this is properly defined, one should try to follow what the particular
package used so far.

> Example: A Debian package `2.0-2` needs a rebuild in Ubuntu which would use
  `2.0-2build1`

List of this and further related examples:

| Previous version                             | No-change rebuild in devel        |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `2.0-2`                                      | `2.0-2build1`                     |
| `2.0-2ubuntu2`                               | `2.0-2ubuntu3`                    |
| `2.0-2build1`                                | `2.0-2build2`                     |
| `2.0-0ubuntu1` (version only in Ubuntu)      | `2.0-0ubuntu2`                    |
| `2.0ubuntu` (native in Ubuntu - new format)  | `2.0ubuntu.build1` or `2.1ubuntu` |
| `2.0ubuntu0` (native in Ubuntu - old format) | `2.0ubuntu.build1` or `2.1ubuntu` |
| `2.0` (native in Debian)                     | `2.0build1`                       |
| `2`   (native in Debian)                     | `2build1`                         |

It is unlikely, but possible that one needs a no-change rebuild as part of a
[Stable release update](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/),
but in this situation auto-syncing isn't active anyway and the need for
upgradability applies. So a no-change-rebuild in regard to picking a version
number in this case is identical to any other change
(see the {ref}`version-adding-a-change-in-ubuntu-as-a-sru` section).


(version-merging-from-debian)=
## Version: Merging from Debian

If Ubuntu has delta to the package from Debian, it can not be
{ref}`automatically synced <sync-process>` otherwise that delta would be lost.
In that case an Ubuntu developer regularly (usually at least once per Ubuntu
release) {ref}`merges the delta <merge-a-package>` in Ubuntu with the content
from Debian and indirectly also with the changes by upstream.

The counter for Ubuntu increments resets to 1, therefore the version for the new
upload to the Ubuntu development is the version from Debian with a suffix of
`ubuntu1`.

> Example: Uploading `3.1` to Ubuntu `-devel` based on Debian `3.1-2` retaining
  former Ubuntu delta of `2.1-1ubuntu2` would become `3.1-2ubuntu1`

List of this and further related examples:

| Old-Debian     | Old-Ubuntu             | New-Debian       | Ubuntu Devel            |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `2.1-1`        | `2.1-1ubuntu2`         | `3.1-2`          | `3.1-2ubuntu1`          |
| `1:7.0+dfsg-7` | `1:7.0+dfsg-7ubuntu14` | `1:8.0.4+dfsg-1` | `1:8.0.4+dfsg-1ubuntu1` |


(version-merging-from-upstream)=
## Version: Merging from Upstream

The mentioned special case of an *upstream merge* is triggered when Ubuntu
merges directly from upstream ahead of Debian upstream. In this case the new
version shall:

* Reflect that it was not yet packaged in Debian (at this point in time) and
  thereby is not *really* based on a Debian version by using `-0` as the Debian
  version suffix.

* Represent that this is the first devel upload via `ubuntu1` which also serves
  as a place increment for further uploads to the development release.

> Example: Uploading `3.1` to Ubuntu `-devel` while Debian is not yet at `3.1`,
  so we pick `3.1` followed by `-0` representing it is not based on Debian and
  `ubuntu1` to index and iterate changes to Ubuntu to an overall `3.1-0ubuntu1`.

List of this and further related examples:

| Old-Debian | Old-Ubuntu      | New-Debian     | New-Upstream | Ubuntu Devel   |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| `2.1-1`    | `2.1-1`         | *unchanged*    | `3.1`        | `3.1-0ubuntu1` |
| `2.1-1`    | `2.1-1ubuntu2`  | *unchanged*    | `3.1`        | `3.1-0ubuntu1` |
| `2.1-1`    | `2.1-1ubuntu2`  | *unchanged*    | `2.3`        | `2.3-0ubuntu1` |


(version-adding-a-change-in-ubuntu-as-a-sru)=
## Version: Adding a change in Ubuntu as a stable release update

After a version of Ubuntu is released, changes to packages follow a slightly
different versioning scheme which ensures upgradability to later releases and
allows the history of changes to be recognized from just looking at the version.

The only change from the normal Ubuntu version scheme is to the
*ubuntu revision* section of `[upstream_version]-[debian_revision]ubuntu[ubuntu_revision]`.

* Increment Y in the numeric `ubuntuX.Y` suffix, like: `ubuntu3.1 -> ubuntu3.2`.

* Never increment X in the numeric `ubuntuX.Y` suffix. An Ubuntu delta is
  always captured in Y.

* If this is the first change via the SRU process, add the `.1` suffix, like:
  `ubuntu3 -> ubuntu3.1`.

* If no `ubuntuX` was present before, then set `ubuntu0.1` which will represent
  that there was no Ubuntu delta (`0`) before this upload which is the first to
  add a change (`.1`).

* If two releases have the same version, then this would make the package
  non-upgradable and cause a version conflict (two builds, but not the same).
  To resolve this, add the numeric `YY.MM` release version in between `ubuntuX`
  and the increment `.1`. For Jammy that suffix might look like `ubuntu3.22.04.1`

Compare these examples with the
{ref}`adding a change in the current Ubuntu development release <version-adding-a-change-in-the-current-ubuntu-development-release>`
section above to better see the subtle difference.

> Example one: Adding a change to `2.0-2` in an Ubuntu stable release update
  will use `2.0-2ubuntu0.1`.

> Example two: Adding an Ubuntu delta to `2.0-2ubuntu2.4` in an Ubuntu stable
  release update will use `2.0-2ubuntu2.5`.

List of these and further related examples:

| Previous version               | Recommended update version                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `2.0-2`                        | `2.0-2ubuntu0.1`                                  |
| `2.0-2ubuntu0.1`               | `2.0-2ubuntu0.2`                                  |
| `2.0-2ubuntu2`                 | `2.0-2ubuntu2.1`                                  |

| `2.0-2ubuntu1` in two releases | `2.0-2ubuntu1.25.04.1` and `2.0-2ubuntu1.24.04.1` |


(version-native-packages)=
## Version: native packages

There exist packages in which Debian or Ubuntu are themselves the upstream.
This is due to the classification as *native* or *non-native* package as
outlined by the referred
[Debian control field version](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#version)
and in more detail [Debian source packages](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#s-source-packages).
To quote: "Presence of the `debian_revision` part indicates this package is a
non-native package. Absence indicates the package is a native package."

Due to that, in a Debian native package there is no `-debian_revision`.

> Example: A package native to Debian `2.0` (no `-`), getting an Ubuntu change
  in the `-devel` release would use `2.0ubuntu1`.

This continues into *native Ubuntu packages*, which also do not have a
`-debian_revision`. But remember that the package namespace is shared between
Debian and Ubuntu, therefore a native Ubuntu package `foo` of version `1.0`
can be overwritten by Debian if they also add a package `foo` > `1.0`.
To prevent this, add an `ubuntu` suffix to the package - otherwise {ref}`auto-sync <merges-syncs>` will use the newer version according to `dpkg --compare-versions`.

We'd also like to be able to differentiate between "a native Debian package that got an Ubuntu Delta added" which could be `2.0ubuntu1`, and "a native Ubuntu package".
Therefore the marker suffix for a **native package** shall be `ubuntu`.
Please migrate the former native package indications "`ubuntu0`" to the new format without `0` (discussion on [ubuntu-devel](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2025-July/043402.html)).

Furthermore, native package versioning is package-dependent; whether it uses
only *major*, or a *major.minor*, or any other version pattern is the
maintainer's choice. Just as upstream can and will version software the way they
consider the best.
Due to that, selecting the right subsequent version requires you to check the
package history or confer with its maintainer.

> Example: A package native to Ubuntu `2.0ubuntu` (no `-`, and `ubuntu` suffix) getting an Ubuntu change in the `-devel` release could use `2.1ubuntu` or `3.0ubuntu`.
  To migrate from the previous format of `2.0ubuntu0`, you can simply update to `2.1ubuntu` or `3.0ubuntu`.

Lists of these and further related examples:

Native in Debian:

| Previous version                 | Devel upload    | SRU upload     |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| `2.0`                            | `2.0ubuntu1`    | `2.0ubuntu0.1` |
| `2`                              | `2ubuntu1`      | `2ubuntu0.1`   |
| `2.0build1`                      | `2.0ubuntu1`    | `2.0ubuntu0.1` |
| `2.0build2`                      | `2.0ubuntu1`    | `2.0ubuntu0.1` |
| `2ubuntu1` (has delta in `-dev`) | `2ubuntu2`      | `2ubuntu1.1`   |

Native in Ubuntu:

| Previous version               | Devel upload                   | SRU upload                              |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `2.0ubuntu`                    | `2.1ubuntu` or `3.0ubuntu`     | `2.0ubuntu0.1`                          |
| `2.0ubuntu0` (old format)      | `2.1ubuntu` or `3.0ubuntu`     | `2.0ubuntu0.1`                          |
| `2ubuntu`                      | `3ubuntu`                      | `2ubuntu0.1`                            |
| `2ubuntu0` (old format)        | `3ubuntu` (new format)         | `2ubuntu0.1`                            |
| `3.1.2ubuntu.build10`          | `3.1.3ubuntu`                  | `3.1.3ubuntu0.1`                        |
| `2ubuntu` in multiple releases | `3ubuntu` or `3ubuntu~26.04.1` | `3ubuntu~25.10.1` and `3ubuntu~25.04.1` |

```{note}

The rule of multiple releases with the same version needing to also add a
per-release `YY.MM` to differentiate and ensure upgradability can be applied here as
well.
```

```{note}

There might be reasons that the maintainer wants the native Ubuntu package to
not have an `ubuntu` suffix, for example if overwriting via auto-sync is desired.

An example might be coordinated uploads to both Distributions in freeze times
when the auto-sync is disabled.

In any such case that deviates from the recommendation to have an `ubuntu`
suffix, the package should have an entry in `debian/README.source` that explains
the reasoning, to allow fellow packagers to understand.

If the deviation is expected to not last very long, for example to be resolved
in the next Ubuntu development cycle, then a note in `debian/changelog` is
sufficient.
```


(version-backport-from-upstream)=
## Version: Backport from upstream

There are more special cases, especially related to backports (as in backports
of new versions via SRU, not as in
[backports](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports).

In the rare case of a *new upstream release being pushed to all stable releases*
it will lose all its former version suffixes. This is a common practice on some
minor release exception processes, where we pick up the most recent upstream
content, but avoid regressions/changes due to packaging changes like moving files,
splitting or removing binary packages etc. To represent this the upload should:

* Signal that it is not based on a Debian packaging version by using `-0` as the
  Debian packaging revision.

* Signal that it was not yet packaged in this Ubuntu release before via
  `ubuntu0.`.

* Add a suffix per Ubuntu release like `.22.04`.

* Add an increment that can be used in subsequent individual per-release SRU
  uploads like `.1`.

> Example: Uploading `3.1` but packaging-wise using what is already in LTS and
  LTS+1 -- not with all the Ubuntu changes that might be in `3.1-1ubuntu2`.

List of this and further related examples:

|       | Old            | New                    |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| LTS   | `2.0-2`        | `3.1-0ubuntu0.22.04.1` |
| LTS+1 | `2.7-2ubuntu1` | `3.1-0ubuntu0.22.10.1` |
| LTS+2 | `2.7-2ubuntu1` | `3.1-0ubuntu0.23.04.1` |

The new version is independent of the former version of the target release. Here
is a list of examples targeting 22.04:

| Previous         | New upstream | Upload for LTS         |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `2.0-2`          | `3.1`        | `3.1-0ubuntu0.22.04.1` |
| `2.0-2ubuntu2`   | `3.1`        | `3.1-0ubuntu0.22.04.1` |
| `2.0-2ubuntu2.1` | `3.1`        | `3.1-0ubuntu0.22.04.1` |
| `2.0-2build1`    | `3.1`        | `3.1-0ubuntu0.22.04.1` |


(version-backport-from-ubuntu-devel)=
## Version: Backport from Ubuntu devel

But if instead the backport is actually without *meaningful differences* to
what is in the current Ubuntu development release (a common practice for some
packages that keep the same version everywhere) with only minimal backporting
adaptations it would instead:

* Signal that is it basically *identical but backported* by starting with the
  same version as the one in the development release.

* Add a `~` to ensure it sorts earlier than the version in `-devel`.

* Add a suffix per Ubuntu release like `22.04`.

* Add an increment that can be used in subsequent individual per release SRU
  uploads like `.1`.

> Example: Uploading `3.1` to LTS and LTS+1 being more or less identical to
  what is in -devel in `3.1-1ubuntu2`.

List of this and further related examples:

|       | Old            | New                    |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| LTS   | `2.0-2`        | `3.1-1ubuntu2~22.04.1` |
| LTS+1 | `2.7-2ubuntu1` | `3.1-1ubuntu2~22.10.1` |
| LTS+2 | `2.7-2ubuntu1` | `3.1-1ubuntu2~23.04.1` |

The new version is again independent of the former version that was present in
the target release. Here are examples targeting 22.04:

| Previous         | New development | Upload for LTS         |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `2.0-2`          | `3.1-1ubuntu2`  | `3.1-1ubuntu2~22.04.1` |
| `2.0-2ubuntu2`   | `3.1-1ubuntu2`  | `3.1-1ubuntu2~22.04.1` |
| `2.0-2ubuntu2.1` | `3.1-1ubuntu2`  | `3.1-1ubuntu2~22.04.1` |
| `2.0-2build1`    | `3.1-1ubuntu2`  | `3.1-1ubuntu2~22.04.1` |

```{note}
If in this case the package in the Ubuntu development release is a native
package one would still use *the same version* as in the development release.
```

> Example: Uploading `3.1` to LTS and LTS+1 being more or less identical to
  what is in `-devel` in `3.1`.

List of this and further related examples:

|       | Old            | New           |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------- |
| LTS   | `2.0-2`        | `3.1~22.04.1` |
| LTS+1 | `2.7-2ubuntu1` | `3.1~22.10.1` |
| LTS+2 | `2.7-2ubuntu1` | `3.1~23.04.1` |


(version-almost-native-packages)=
## Version: almost native packages

Let us be clear, *almost native packages* is not a clear definition, but some
have evolved that way.

An example is `snapd`, which is packaged like a native package in Ubuntu with
versions like `2.67+25.04`, the content matches 1:1 what is upstream (including
the `debian/*` being there), and being packaged as `3.0 (native)`.
But the package versions are nowadays no more *defined* by these native uploads
to Ubuntu. There actually is a
[separate upstream project with proper releases](https://github.com/canonical/snapd/tags).

Furthermore the Debian packaging switched over to proper upstream/downstream
packaging with orig tarball, Debian additions and a version like `2.67-1` and
format being `3.0 (quilt)`.

Due to that, some of the normal rules no more apply. Changing the example
`2.67` to `2.67.1` is no more just an Ubuntu-native version choice. It
represents a new upstream version in the upstream project which might not exist
or not match.

Furthermore the example of `snapd` is also usually backported with the same
content to all active releases. Combined that makes this an uncommon mix of the
rules usually applied to:

* Native package

* Backport from upstream

Let us define how such a case could be handled for the example of `snapd`:

* The first element of the version matches the upstream version it represents,
  like `2.67`

* Since this is backported to multiple releases at the same version, but being
  native can't have a `-` like in the usual `-X` or `-XubuntuY` -- but it can
  have the suffix is added via `+ubuntuYY.MM`

  * Note: former versions just added `+YY.MM` but for symmetry and to avoid e.g.
    conflicts with the auto-sync process `+ubuntuYY.MM` should be the way to go

* If iterations on the same upstream version and for the same target Ubuntu
  release are needed add an increment counter `.x` as suffix

| Previous                    | New upstream 2.67  | Changes inside of 2.66 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| LTS: `2.66+ubuntu24.04`     | `2.67+ubuntu24.04` | `2.66+ubuntu24.04.1`   |
| Devel: `2.66+ubuntu25.04`   | `2.67+ubuntu25.04` | `2.66+ubuntu25.04.1`   |
| LTS: `2.66+ubuntu24.04.1`   | `2.67+ubuntu24.04` | `2.66+ubuntu24.04.2`   |
| Devel: `2.66+ubuntu25.04.1` | `2.67+ubuntu25.04` | `2.66+ubuntu25.04.2`   |

```{note}

Yes, no more being a *real* native package means this could also become
`2.68-0ubuntu1` and thereby the more "normal" rules would apply, but
until the release process can handle it the above is an example how we can
apply the same rules outlined here to almost any case and still ensure
upgradability and some reasonable instant insight looking at only the
version number.

## Version: Undoing mistakes

In a very rare case where an upgrade to a new upstream version of a package
caused major regression and the only way out is rolling back, the convention is
to insert `+really` followed by the actual version number.

To be clear, both should be used sparingly and only if really needed.
Please also have a look at
[+really in control fields](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#epochs-should-be-used-sparingly).

> Example: Uploading `3.1` caused a regression, so rolling back to the previous
  version `2.0-2ubuntu2` would use `3.1+really2.0-2ubuntu2`

List of this and further related examples:

| Before           | Current        | Upload                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `2.0-2ubuntu2`   | `3.1-2ubuntu1` | `3.1+really2.0-2ubuntu2`                               |
| `7.80+dfsg1-5`   | `7.91+dfsg1-1` | `7.91+dfsg1+really7.80+dfsg1-1ubuntu1` (Ubuntu upload) |
| `7.80+dfsg1-5`   | `7.91+dfsg1-1` | `7.91+dfsg1+really7.80+dfsg1-1` (Debian upload)        |
| `7.80+dfsg1-5`   | `7.91+dfsg1-1` | `7.91+dfsg1+really7.80+dfsg1-1ubuntu0.1` (Ubuntu SRU)  |

## Further reading

Right at the beginning we had the link to the underlying concepts in Debian
referring to the [Debian control field "Version"](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#version)
for overall topic awareness.

But of course there are more special cases, one that you might encounter is
package uploads based on repository content. This is most commonly done:

* If upstreams do not yet have a new release, but we'd like to have all the
  content up to a certain point in time/git

* In cases where the upstream release is imminent, but to meet freeze deadlines
  one uploads the state from git (but going to final before the release)

* If upstream is only using nightly builds and you need to pick one of them

At a high level you'd either go before the next version
`{upcoming_version}~git...` or, if this seems more appropriate to the case,
ahead of the current `{current_version}+git...`.

The former is more common, the latter a special case, for example considered if
nobody knows if/when/what the new revision will be.

The underlying principles are outlined in more detail in the
[Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Versioning).

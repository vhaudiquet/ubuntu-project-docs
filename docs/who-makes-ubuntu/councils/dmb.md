The Ubuntu Developer Membership Board grants Membership to {ref}`Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-developers>`.
The term for DMB membership is 2 years.
You can find the list of current [Developer Membership Board members](https://launchpad.net/~developer-membership-board/+members) on Launchpad.


## Communication

The DMB currently holds {ref}`meetings <dmb-meetings>` every two weeks.

Most asynchronous conversation happens on the [`devel-permissions` mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/devel-permissions).
This mailing list is public ([`devel-permissions@archives`](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/)), as are our general process and policy discussions.
If private communication is required, such as discussing the performance of an individual, then use the [private `developer-membership-board` list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/developer-membership-board).
  
You can discuss developer application matters on the {matrix}`devel` Matrix channel.

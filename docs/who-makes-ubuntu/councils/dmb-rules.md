# DMB rules

This section contains rules and regulations for the {ref}`dmb` to use when conducting its business.
Changes to these rules should be proposed by a board member and voted on by the board.


## Board Member attendance

The final formal wording is from [this post](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2021-October/001750.html) and is reproduced here:

> Any DMB member who fails to attend 6 consecutive scheduled DMB meetings (during a period no shorter than 12 weeks) shall be considered inactive and removed from membership in the DMB.
> Since the number of members required for quorum is 1/2 the number of active DMB members, rounded up, the change in the number of active members will affect quorum.
> At such time as any DMB member is found to be inactive due to this rule, the current DMB chair will add an action item to schedule a public vote for a new DMB member.
> Previous DMB members, including those changed to inactive due to this rule, are eligible to run in the new election and any later elections.
> This proposal is not retroactive, and the attendance requirement shall start the first meeting after this proposal is adopted.

```{note}
This rule [was proposed](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2021-August/001726.html) on the mailing list, and [approved on 2021-11-05](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2021-November/001780.html).

(dmb-voting-and-quorum)=
## Voting and quorum

Applications must reach +1 in order to pass.
If the meeting is quorate and all members present vote in the same way (+1 or -1), then the application will have passed or failed -- the remaining members cannot overturn the vote.
If the vote is in doubt then it is *hung* and the remaining members will be asked to vote by email or at the next meeting.
In this case those members are entitled to ask the applicant further questions if they still have any upon reviewing the meeting log.

> Quorum votes are required to make any decision., however if quorum is not reached at first meeting, at the next meeting majority present votes are required.

The details for this rule, and **quorum** voting in particular, are not always clear, so the TL:DR for this rule is, any proposal or application that is voted on at a regular meeting must use the process shown in the Python function below;
if the function does not result in pass or fail, then at the next scheduled meeting, the vote will pass with only a majority of present members (meaning the sum of votes from present members must be greater than 0).

```{note}
This rule was proposed and approved in a [mailing list thread](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2021-August/001728.html), that was discussed and then [extended to a poll](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2021-October/001756.html) for which [the results](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2021-November/001782.html) are explained below.
```

As *quorum* can be difficult to parse under all circumstances, an explanation from a [mailing list post](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2021-October/001763.html) (and [follow up post](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/devel-permissions/2021-October/001764.html) for a tie vote) is summarized in this Python function, where `total_members` is the total number of **active** board members (which is typically 7):

```none
def do_vote(*votes, total_members=7):

  absent = total_members - len(votes)

  net_vote = sum(votes)

  min = net_vote - absent

  max = net_vote + absent

  if min > 0:

    print(f'Vote minimum {min} > 0, vote passes')

  elif max < 0:

    print(f'Vote maximum {max} < 0, vote fails')

  elif min == max == net_vote == 0:

    print(f'Vote is tied, vote fails')

  else:

    print(f'Vote is between {min} and {max}, outcome unknown as quorum was not reached')
```

This function represents the meaning of **quorum** votes.
Note that if **`total_members`** is 7, if the number of voters is less than 4, it is impossible to pass or fail.


(dmb-application-communication)=
## Application-related communication

The following details [are agreed on](http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2009/10/13/%23ubuntu-meeting.html):

* [`devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com`](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/devel-permissions) list will be used.

* Invitations/applications go there as well as to relevant team lists.

* All approvals go to `ubuntu-devel@` (meeting minutes) and `devel-permissions@` (individual outcomes) (maybe also to the team list).

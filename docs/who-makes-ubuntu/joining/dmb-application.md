To become an {ref}`Ubuntu Developer Member <ubuntu-developer-membership>`, or a developer of a delegated team for which the {ref}`dmb` handles applications, you must apply via the process outlined on this page.
The DMB covers applications for {ref}`ubuntu-developers-contributing`, {ref}`Per-Package Uploaders (PPU) <ubuntu-developers-per-package>`, {ref}`Package Set uploaders <membership-in-packageset>`, {ref}`Ubuntu Developers (from delegated teams) <ubuntu-developers-delegated>`, {ref}`MOTU <ubuntu-developers-motu>`, {ref}`SRU developers <ubuntu-developers-sru>`, and {ref}`Ubuntu Core Developers (core-dev) <ubuntu-developers-core-dev>`.
  
It can be difficult to know when you are ready to apply for uploader team membership.
For some advice and guidance, check out the {ref}`dmb-aspects-of-a-good-application` page.
To understand how the Ubuntu development skills map to the various uploader levels, you may also find it helpful to refer to {ref}`dmb-application-knowledge-requirements`.


## Application process overview

Reserve your spot
: Check the Developer Membership Board (DMB) [agenda](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-developer-membership-board-agenda/66634) to see when the DMB next meeting is, and to check the queue of applications.
: Only 2 applications are considered each meeting so if there's a queue, make sure to reserve a spot for when you think you'll be ready for consideration.

Create your space
: If it's your first time applying for upload rights, {ref}`dmb-create-a-discourse-post`. If you already have a page, you can
  reuse it.

Training and preparation
: The depth of your learning here depends on the upload rights you are applying
  for:
: 1. {ref}`PPU or Package Set <packageset-training-and-preparation>`  
: 1. {ref}`MOTU <motu-training-and-preparation>`
: 1. {ref}`Core Developer <core-dev-training-and-preparation>`

Prepare application form
: {ref}`dmb-prepare-application-form` on your Discourse post.

Collect endorsements
: {ref}`dmb-collect-endorsements` from those who have worked with you.

Once you have enough endorsements
: If you haven't already, add yourself to the [DMB agenda](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-developer-membership-board-agenda/66634).
: Then you can announce your application and meeting date by writing an email to the `devel-permissions@` mailing list. Your email should include:

  * The link to your Discourse application page

  * The date you reserved for your meeting

  * A link to the meeting agenda

Attend your meeting
: Then you can {ref}`attend your meeting <dmb-application-meeting>`, answer questions, and receive your votes.


(dmb-create-a-discourse-post)=
## Create a Discourse post

Create a dedicated Discourse page for your application in the [Developer Membership section](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/community/developer-membership/423), using the [Developer Application Template](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/developer-application-template/66670).

On this page you should (at least):

* Introduce yourself and your past Ubuntu-related work

* Include a "Contact Information" section with

  * Your Matrix nickname

  * Your Launchpad ID

You can look at other people's pages for ideas of other things you can include.
You'll be reusing this text in your membership applications later.


(dmb-prepare-application-form)=
## Prepare your application form

In your {ref}`personal Discourse page <dmb-create-a-discourse-post>`, copy and paste the [Developer Application Template](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/developer-application-template/66670) and add your details in each section.

Specify in your post title what upload rights you're applying for.

```{note}
You can look at [past Wiki applications](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Home?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=DeveloperApplication&titlesearch=Titles) such as [{spellexception}`Paride`'s](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ParideLegovini/UbuntuServerDeveloperApplication) or check out the Discourse [Ubuntu Membership section](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/community/membership/93) if you need some examples.
```


(dmb-collect-endorsements)=
## Collect endorsements

To gain upload rights, you'll need to collect endorsements from people who have sponsored your packages.
Ask other developers to endorse your application by replying to your Discourse page.

A typical application has three to five endorsements.
Developers who [sponsored several uploads for you](https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi) are good candidates.
It's good form to only ask people who have sponsored multiple packages for you, or that have worked with you on particularly tricky packaging efforts.
You want to strike a good balance between quality and quantity here.
 
If you work for Canonical, ask in your team's regular discussion channels, and individually contact each sponsor who is not in your team.

For applications for MOTU, you should seek endorsements from people who have reviewed or sponsored your packages, or worked with you on noteworthy packaging efforts.
If you work for Canonical, seek out diversity in your endorsers by looking outside your immediate team.
Since MOTU is more focused on community maintainers, their testimonials are of particular value.
Even words from noteworthy Debian maintainers can carry weight for MOTU applications.


(dmb-application-meeting)=
## What to expect at the DMB meeting

All members of the development community are welcome to attend and ask questions, add your feedback (even if unsolicited) as comments to the application Discourse page or ask questions of an applicant on the [`devel-permissions` mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/devel-permissions).

Please note that anyone applying for an Ubuntu development team membership is required to have read and signed the {ref}`Ubuntu Code of Conduct <code-of-conduct>`, as visible under `https://launchpad.net/~<LPUSERNAME>/+codesofconduct`.

The {ref}`dmb` will have prepared for the meeting (reviewed the application details, checked a few examples of your work, talked to sponsors, etc.) and ask questions to make sure the applicant qualifies for the team.
During the meeting the DMB members will cast their votes.

There is no mandatory abstinence of voters due to knowing the applicant -- after all we are looking for just that: evidence and endorsements from people who know the applicant's work and behavior.
If a DMB member feels biased by having a personal relationship they can choose to abstain to avoid a conflict of interest.

If quorum is reached (4 of 7 currently), the applicant will be added to the requested team.
If no approving quorum was reached the DMB members might, if possible, suggest what to study or work on, and ask the applicant to then re-apply in due time.

For part of the world (e.g APAC) where the DMB meeting times can be challenging to attend due to the timezone gap, note that the DMB usually tries to be accomodating.
While the preference always remains the Matrix interview meeting, the DMB team can exceptionally do the interview by email if the applicant cannot make the regular meeting times.
Please reach out to the DMB team to let them know if you fall into this category.


## Debian Developers applying for Per-Package Upload rights

The DMB has established a procedure for interested Debian Developers to gain upload rights to their packages, on a dynamic and ongoing basis.
That is, the list of packages one can upload can be further extended after the initial application to include other packages the Debian Developer maintains.
This includes team-maintained packages.

To exercise this process, the Debian Developer should first be an existing Ubuntu developer, for example by applying for Per-Package Upload rights as per the above process or by joining the MOTU team if interest is broad.
Subsequent changes are requested by mailing `devel-permissions@lists.ubuntu.com` listing the packages to add. This only requires one DMB member to agree in order to pass.
If the "impact" of the packages changes -- for example, one of the packages is part of release media for the first time -- the DMB may wish to ask some further clarifying questions to satisfy itself that the Debian Developer is sufficiently familiar with the differences between Ubuntu and Debian to upload the package(s) in question without supervision.



## Applying for upload permissions which grant no further access

The DMB recognizes that individuals may wish to become members of teams they have no *technical* reason to want to join, so that they may feel explicitly included as a member of the team.

For such "social" applications, the DMB will expect to see evidence of a large degree of social involvement in the team.
Examples include mentoring new contributors and discussing policy.

It would be helpful if applicants could seek endorsements from existing members of the team when applying.

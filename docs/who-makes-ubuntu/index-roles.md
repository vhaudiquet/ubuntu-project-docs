# Roles and responsibilities


This section will allow us to split out explanation content specifically needed
by the teams/roles to fulfill their tasks, new members to learn, and for
prospective members to understand what the role entails

Each of these sections can have a team-specific landing page to act as a
secondary layer of drop-down menus

# SRU Developers

SRU Developers are developers with a specialisation in working on [Stable Release Updates](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/) in Ubuntu.
They are granted direct upload to the Ubuntu Archive for all packages -- but only to the stable releases.

## Training and preparation

SRU Devs have uploads subject to the standard SRU process, including review from SRU team members and all other SRU policies.
They have a good track record of sponsored SRUs, thus demonstrating an understanding of SRU policies, requirements and process.

They also drive SRUs through to the end, not letting things languish in `-proposed`.
Developers who focus on package-specific areas in Ubuntu, such as {ref}`MOTU <dmb-joining-motu>` and {ref}`dmb-joining-packageset` also upload SRUs without necessarily being a member of the SRU developers team.
By contrast, SRU developers work on SRUs across different sections of the Ubuntu Package Archive.


## Voting

SRU Developers are granted a vote when the {ref}`Development Membership Board <dmb>` or Technical Board are polling Ubuntu Developers.


## Join SRU developers

First, check the general requirements for {ref}`ubuntu-membership`.
Make sure you meet the {ref}`sru-dev-training-and-preparation` description, and that your sponsors are willing to endorse your application.

You can then apply to the {ref}`Developer Membership Board <dmb>` using the {ref}`application process <dmb-application>`.


## Next steps

Depending on your interest, after becoming an SRU developer you may wish to go for:

* {ref}`dmb-joining-ppu`
* {ref}`dmb-joining-packageset`
* {ref}`dmb-joining-motu`
* {ref}`dmb-joining-core-dev`

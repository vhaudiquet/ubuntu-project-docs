# DMB application knowledge requirements

There are several {ref}`dmb-aspects-of-a-good-application`, but questions are often asked around what knowledge and evidence an applicant should provide.

In the table below we show the topics, descriptions of what the topic includes, and the depth to which the topic should be understood for each role.
We do not expect rote memorization of answers. 
The objective is to determine your understanding of the underlying reasons for those answers.
This often requires a thorough understanding of the policies, technologies, and processes pertinent to a given topic.

Therefore, while contributing to the Ubuntu project, your focus should be on cultivating understanding rather than being able to provide answers to a predetermined set of questions.
Consider the following not as "questions you must be able to answer," but rather as "topics to comprehend, accompanied by a few illustrative questions that have arisen in the past."

\*1: "Expected level" is a non-linear, non-unit description of how deep a particular topic should be covered. Abbreviated as B \= Basic, I \= Intermediate, A \= Advanced. If an E is present in the column, this will be mostly demonstrated by Evidence over being able to answer questions.

\*2: The expected level for PPU differs a lot, the outlined ratings are for non-seeded leaf packages not affecting boot. Applying for PPU of more important packages might have higher expectations with the context of those packages in mind.

| Topic | Description => Expected level\*¹ | |  |  |  |  |

| **Quality assurance** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Ubuntu Proposed Migrations** |  Understand that uploading or sponsoring is not the moment when you are done; what is {ref}`proposed-migration` -- what value does it provide to the project and how to deal with the most common cases and issues. | B | I | I | A | A |

| **Active Releases** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Ubuntu Stable Release Update process** | Broad understanding of all [SRU types](https://canonical-sru-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest) and how to drive them. Detailed understanding of the specifics required for a standard SRU. Able to identify the next step needed for any given SRU. | B | I | A | I | A |

| Upload and testing of stable release updates (SRU) | Demonstrate experience of stable release updates to packages in Ubuntu. Multiple uploads to the same package are good, but the wider the application should allow uploads, the more demonstrating some width is required. | BE | BE | IE | IE | AE |

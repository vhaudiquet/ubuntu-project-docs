# Core Developers

Core Developers (Core Devs) are members of the [`ubuntu-core-dev`](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev) team in Launchpad.
Core Devs collectively maintain all packages in Ubuntu, which notably includes uploading to the `main` component.
Core Devs also have elevated privileges for re-triggering autopkgtests and performing other administrative actions in Ubuntu.

## Training and preparation

In terms of the {ref}`uploaders-journey`, MOTU are {ref}`experts <upload-path-expert>` in Ubuntu Development, with a strong working knowledge of packaging concepts and techniques, refined through direct experience. They can apply this knowledge to a variety of packages and sub-systems, and have a history of substantial direct contributions to the Ubuntu distribution.

Most people applying for Core Dev membership will have a history of involvement in Ubuntu, working their way up from {ref}`Package Set <dmb-joining-packageset>` and/or {ref}`MOTU <dmb-joining-MOTU>` membership.
If you're skipping over those levels it is nevertheless worth reviewing their training and application processes to make sure you'll be fulfilling their requirements.

In addition to understanding common tasks documented in this guide, including {ref}`Debian patching <work-with-debian-patches>`, {ref}`Stable Release Updates (SRUs) <fix-a-bug-in-a-package>`, and so on, Core Dev applicants must also have a good understanding of these advanced packaging skills, and ideally direct experience with a few of them:

* {ref}`Package sponsorship <sponsorship>`
* {ref}`Seed handling <seed-management>`
* {ref}`Main inclusion <main-inclusion-review>` for packages
* [New package](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages) integration
* {ref}`Transition <transitions>` of packages with new ABI/API requirements
* [SRU special case exceptions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/reference/package-specific/)


Core Devs have a strong working knowledge of Ubuntu project procedures (especially those related to the {ref}`release process <ubuntu-releases>` and support commitments), and an understanding of why they exist; e.g. having done an [SRU](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sru/en/latest/) or [security fix](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePreparation).


### Trust

As with applications for {ref}`MOTU <dmb-joining-MOTU>`, trustworthiness is crucial for Core Devs.
Being able to work with others, and especially *mentoring* others is extremely important.
Look for opportunities to exercise and demonstrate these attributes, and discuss them in your application.


### Qualities

Core Devs take a leading role in new development projects to improve Ubuntu.
This means they can specify, develop and deploy new features for the default installation of Ubuntu.

They feel a sense of personal responsibility for the quality of Ubuntu releases and for the satisfaction of Ubuntu users.

They exercise great care in their work, with the understanding that their efforts have a direct impact on others, including:

* Every Ubuntu user

* The Ubuntu release team

* Corporate partners who provide support for Ubuntu


## Voting

Ubuntu Core Developers are granted a vote when the {ref}`dmb` or Technical Board are polling Ubuntu Developers.


## Become a Core Developer

First check the general requirements for {ref}`ubuntu-membership`.
You can then apply to the {ref}`dmb` using the {ref}`dmb-application`.


## Next steps

While Core Dev is the highest level for packaging development, there are several specialized administrative teams that help keep the Archive healthy:

* {ref}`dmb`
* [Technical Board](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard)
* {ref}`Archive Administration <archive-administration>`
* The SRU team

# Per-Package Uploaders

Per-Package Uploaders are developers with a specialization in a specific package (or packages) in Ubuntu.
They are granted direct upload to the Ubuntu Archive for those packages.

## Training and preparation

In terms of the Ubuntu {ref}`uploaders-journey`, Per-Package Uploaders are considered somewhere between an {ref}`upload-path-intermediate`- and {ref}`upload-path-advanced`-level Developer, and they may need to go further into the Advanced path depending on the complexity of the package they wish to help maintain.

```{include} /who-makes-ubuntu/developers/diagrams/intermediate.txt
```

Per-Package Uploaders are **specialist**, not generalist, maintainers.
They are not expected to understand packaging best practices as applicable to a wide variety of software, or large number of packages in the Archive.
They *are* expected to have exceptional technical expertise with the package(s) for which access is requested.

They have enough technical knowledge of the package(s) in question from documented work in the package through sponsorship, work in other distributions, or work upstream.
They understand that such upload access does not permit sole-maintainership, but rather the right to participate in the maintenance of the package(s) as part of a team.

Per-Package Uploaders Understand the broad strokes of the {ref}`release schedule <ubuntu-releases>`, {ref}`relevant freezes <freezes>` affecting the package(s) in question, and the appropriate means by which to handle any exceptions.

They need to demonstrate a history of effective collaboration with other developers in Ubuntu.
They need to show advocacy and support from existing developers, indicating that their previous work on the package warrants unsupervised upload rights.
They also need to have documented previous concern for the packages in question in Ubuntu, including previous uploads, effective bug management, etc.


### Debian Developers

There is a slightly special procedure for Debian Developers wishing to have upload rights to their packages. See {ref}`application process <dmb-application>`.


## Voting

PPU members are granted a vote when the {ref}`dmb` or Technical Board are polling Ubuntu Developers.


## Become a Per-Package Uploader

First check the general requirements for {ref}`ubuntu-membership`.
You can then apply to the {ref}`dmb` using the {ref}`dmb-application`.


## Next steps

If you have an interest in a wide variety of packages, you are encouraged to strive for membership in one or more existing development teams. You may, depending on your interest, choose to go for:

* {ref}`dmb-joining-packageset`
* {ref}`dmb-joining-motu`
* {ref}`dmb-joining-core-dev`

# Staging area

This staging area exists to help you preview content you're working on before
it is ready to be moved to the documentation itself.

If you have content where there are multiple sources that need to be combined,
you can store them here while you work on them. Any pages that contain the
original content should be `.txt` files so that Sphinx ignores them. The page
that will eventually be moved into the docs can have a `.md` file type.

This page (and staging area) will be removed as it becomes unnecessary.

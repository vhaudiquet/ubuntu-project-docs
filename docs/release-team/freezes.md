(freezes)=
# Freezes

This article provides an overview of the stabilization milestones that lead to
the release of a new version of Ubuntu. The series of milestones (freezes) means
the gradual introduction of restrictions on modifications in certain areas, so
that the distribution can stabilize as it nears the final release.

See {ref}`release-cycle` for an overview of the entire release process.


(testing-weeks)=
## Testing weeks

During a release's development phase, the {ref}`release-team` organizes testing
weeks to focus the Ubuntu community's efforts on testing Ubuntu's latest daily
{term}`ISO images <Image>` and its {term}`flavors <Ubuntu flavors>`. These weeks
are crucial for discovering bugs and getting early feedback about new features.

```{note}
The testing weeks replaced the older practice of alpha and beta milestones. For
example, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) had Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1, and Beta 2
milestones.

See [the email](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2018-April/004434.html)
that announced the process change.
```

(debian-import-freeze)=
## Debian Import Freeze

Archive Admins disable the automatic import of new packages and versions of
existing packages from Debian. The import of a new package or version of an
existing package from Debian needs to be requested.

```{note}
The general development activity is still unrestricted until the Feature Freeze;
however, the Feature Freeze is often scheduled for the same day.
```

(feature-freeze-ff)=
## Feature Freeze (FF)

At this point, Ubuntu developers should stop introducing new features, packages,
and {term}`API`/{term}`ABI` changes, and instead concentrate on fixing bugs in
the current release in development.


(user-interface-freeze-uif)=
## User Interface Freeze (UIF)

The user interface (UI) should be finalized to allow documentation writers and
translators to work on a consistent target that doesn't render screenshots or
documentation obsolete.

After the User Interface Freeze, the following things are not allowed to change
without a {ref}`freeze exception <freeze-exceptions>`:

* User Interface of individual applications installed by default
* Appearance of the desktop
* Distribution-specific artwork
* All user-visible strings in the Desktop and applications installed by default


(documentation-string-freeze)=
## Documentation String Freeze

Documentation strings should no longer be created or modified. This freeze
ensures the documentation can be accurately translated.

Exceptions to this rule may be considered before the release for significant and
glaring errors or exceptional circumstances.


(kernel-feature-freeze)=
## Kernel Feature Freeze

The {term}`kernel` feature development should end at this point, and the kernels
can be considered feature-complete for the release. From now on, only bug-fix
changes are expected.

```{note}
The Kernel Feature Freeze occurs after the {ref}`feature-freeze-ff` because the
Linux Kernel is typically released upstream after the Feature Freeze.
Additionally, the Kernel Feature Freeze is deliberately scheduled so that the
Beta images have a fully featured kernel suitable for testing.
```

(hardware-enablement-freeze)=
## Hardware Enablement Freeze

All new hardware enablement tasks for devices targeting the given release should
be finished, and all the respective packages should be in the Ubuntu Package
Archive. The release team no longer accepts changes in the Ubuntu Package
Archive related to supporting new image types or platforms. This freeze ensures
that any new platforms are already available for testing of the beta images and
in the weeks leading to the {ref}`final-freeze`.

```{note}
The Hardware Enablement Freeze is usually scheduled for the same day as the Beta
Freeze.
```

(beta-freeze)=
## Beta Freeze

In preparation for the beta release, all uploads are queued and subject to
manual approval by the release team. Changes to packages that affect beta
release images (flavours included) require the release team's approval before
uploading. Uploads for packages that do not affect images are generally accepted
as time permits.

```{tip}
Use the {manpage}`seeded-in-ubuntu(1)` tool, provided by the `ubuntu-dev-tools`
package, to list all current daily images containing a specified package or to
determine whether the specified package is part of the supported seed.

If the list output is empty, uploading it during a freeze should be safe.
```

The freeze allows Archive Admins to fix package inconsistencies or critical bugs
quickly and in an isolated manner. Once the beta release is shipped, the Beta
Freeze restrictions no longer apply.


(kernel-freeze)=
## Kernel Freeze

The Kernel Freeze is the final date for kernel updates because they require
several lockstep actions that must be folded into the image-building process.

Exceptional circumstances may justify exemptions to the freeze at the discretion
of the release managers.


(non-language-pack-translation-deadline)=
## Non-language-pack translation deadline

Some translation data cannot currently be updated via the language pack
mechanism. Because these items require more disruptive integration work, they
are subject to an earlier deadline to give developers time to manually export
translations from Launchpad and integrate them into the package.

This marks the date after which translations for such packages are not
guaranteed to be included in the final release. Depending on the package and its
maintainers' workflow, they may be exported later.

Other packages can still be translated until the
{ref}`language-pack-translation-deadline`.


(final-freeze)=
## Final Freeze

This freeze marks an **extremely** high-caution period until the
{ref}`final-release`. Only bug fixes for release-critical, security-critical or
otherwise "exceptional circumstance" bugs are included in the Final Release,
which the release team and relevant section teams must confirm.


### Unseeded packages

Packages in {ref}`archive-components-universe` that aren't seeded in any of the
Ubuntu flavours remain in {ref}`feature-freeze-ff` because they do not affect
the release; however, when the Ubuntu Package Archive is frozen, fixes must be
manually reviewed and accepted by the release team members.

When the Final Release is close (~1.5 days out), developers should consider
uploading to the {ref}`-proposed pocket <archive-pockets-proposed>`, from which
the release team cherry-picks into the
{ref}`-release pocket <archive-pockets-release>` if circumstances allow. All
packages uploaded to the `-proposed` pocket that do not make it into the
`-release` pocket until the Final Release become candidates for
{ref}`stable-release-updates`. Therefore, uploads to the `-proposed` pocket
during Final Freeze should meet the requirements of Stable Release Updates if
the upload is not accepted into the `-release` pocket. In particular, the upload
must reference at least one bug, which is used to track the stable update.

```{note}
If you are sure that your upload will be accepted during Final Freeze, you can
upload directly to the `-release` pocket, but be aware that you must re-upload
after Final Release if the upload is rejected.
```


(release-candidate)=
## Release Candidate

The images produced during the week before the {ref}`final-release` are
considered "release candidates". In an ideal world, the first release candidate
would end up being the Final Release; however, we don't live in a perfect world,
and this week is used to get rid of the last release-critical bugs and do as
much testing as possible. Until the Final Release, changes are only permitted at
the release team's discretion and will only be allowed for high-priority bugs
that might justify delaying the release.


(language-pack-translation-deadline)=
## Language pack translation deadline

Translations done up until this date are included in the final release's
language packs.

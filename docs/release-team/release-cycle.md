# Release cycle

Each release cycle follows the same general pattern with a number of major
phases. Ubuntu contributors are expected to follow this process closely to
ensure their work is aligned with that of others. Because of the time-based
release cycle, Ubuntu contributors must coordinate well to produce an on-time
release.

See also the article {ref}`ubuntu-releases` for details about the release
cadence.


## Beginning a new release

The Ubuntu infrastructure is prepared for a new development branch at the start
of each cycle. The package build system is set up, the toolchain is organized,
{term}`seeds` are branched, and many other pieces are made ready before
development can properly begin. Once these preparations are made, the new branch
is officially announced on the
[`ubuntu-devel-announce` mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-announce)
and opened for uploads to the {ref}`package-archive`.

```{note}
See the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)
[Archive opening announcement email](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2023-October/001341.html)
as an example.
```

## Planning

Ubuntu contributors discuss the targeted features for each release cycle via the
various channels (IRC, Matrix, Discourse, Launchpad). Some of these come from
strategic priorities for the distribution as a whole, and some are proposed by
individual developers.

The broader open-source community gets together at the {term}`Ubuntu Summit`
(similar but different to the past
{term}`Ubuntu Developer Summits <Ubuntu Developer Summit>`) to share experiences
and ideas, and to inspire future projects covering development as well as
design, writing, and community leadership with a wide range of technical skill
levels.


## Merging with upstream and feature development

The first phase of the release cycle is characterized by bringing new releases
of {term}`upstream` components into Ubuntu, either directly or via
{ref}`merges-syncs`. The development of planned projects for the release often
begins while merging is still underway, and the development accelerates once the
Package Archive is reasonably consistent and usable.

The automatic import of new package versions from Debian ends at the
{ref}`debian-import-freeze`.


(monthly-snapshots)=
## Monthly Snapshots

During a release's development phase, the
{ref}`Canonical Release Management team <release-team>` organizes
[monthly snapshot releases](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/supercharging-ubuntu-releases-monthly-snapshots-automation/61876). These releases are not intended to
be used in production, but rather are curated, testable milestones that can be
used to detect failure modes during the development cycle.


## Stabilization and freezes

Developers should increasingly exercise caution in making changes to Ubuntu to
ensure a stable state is reached in time for the final release date. Archive
Admins incrementally restrict modifications to the Ubuntu Package Archive,
effectively freezing it. The milestones when these restrictions get enabled are
called "freezes".

During freezes, developers must request {ref}`freeze-exceptions` to approve
changes (see also {ref}`request-a-freeze-exception`). The Release Team posts the
current Release Schedule as a Discourse article under the
["Release" topic](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/project/release). It shows the
typical order and length of the various freezes.

See {ref}`freezes` for an overview of the individual stabilization milestones.


## Finalization

As the final release approaches, the focus narrows to fixing "showstopper" bugs
and thoroughly validating the installation images. Every image is tested to
ensure the installation methods work as advertised. Low-impact bugs and other
issues are deprioritized to focus developers on this effort.

This phase is vital, as severe bugs that affect the experience of booting or
installing the images must be fixed before the final release. By contrast,
ordinary bugs affecting the installed system can be fixed with Stable Release
Updates.


(final-release)=
## Final Release

Once the Release Team declares the {ref}`release-candidate` ISO stable and names
it the "Final Release", a representative of the team announces it on the
[`ubuntu-announce` mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/).

```{note}

[release announcement](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2024-April/000301.html).
